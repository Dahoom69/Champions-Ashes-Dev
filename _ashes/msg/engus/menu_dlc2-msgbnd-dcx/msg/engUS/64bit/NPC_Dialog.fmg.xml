<text id="500">Ahh, you ignorant slaves. Finally taken notice, have you?</text>
<text id="501">Of the power of my beloved Ocelotte, child of dragons.</text>
<text id="502">Well, I will not give him up.</text>
<text id="503">For he is all that I have.</text>
<text id="600">Oh, dear brother...</text>
<text id="601">I'm on my way...</text>
<text id="602">My brother, unyielding sword of Lothric's Prince.</text>
<text id="603">Rise, if you would.</text>
<text id="604">...For that is our curse.</text>
<text id="700">Oh dear, another dogged contender.</text>
<text id="701">Welcome, Unkindled one, purloiner of cinders.</text>
<text id="702">Mind you, the mantle of lord interests me none.</text>
<text id="703">The fire-linking curse, the legacy of lords, let it all fade into nothing.</text>
<text id="704">Ill-starred are they who take the throne. I shall not stand among them.</text>
<text id="705">You've done quite enough, now have your rest.</text>
<text id="706">The royal sword of Lothric shall grant you peace.</text>

<text id="3201">But why, ashen one...</text>
<text id="3202">Great lord of dark...</text>
<text id="1000000">Yes, indeed.</text>
<text id="1000001">It is called Lothric,</text>
<text id="1000002">where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge.</text>
<text id="1000100">In venturing north,</text>
<text id="1000101">the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words.</text>
<text id="1000200">"The fire fades,</text>
<text id="1000300">When the link of fire is threatened, the bell tolls,</text>
<text id="1000301">unearthing the old Lords of Cinder from their graves.</text>
<text id="1000400">Aldrich, Saint of the Deep.</text>
<text id="1000401">Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers.</text>
<text id="1000402">And the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital,</text>
<text id="1000403">Yhorm the Giant.</text>
<text id="1000500">Only, in truth...</text>
<text id="1000501">The Lords will abandon their thrones,</text>
<text id="1000502">and the Unkindled will rise.</text>
<text id="1000600">Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder.</text>
<text id="1000601">And so it is.</text>
<text id="1000602">That ash seeketh embers.</text>
<text id="2000000">Welcome to the bonfire, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="2000001">I am a Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="2000002">I tend to the flame, and tend to thee.</text>
<text id="2000003">The Lords have left their thrones, and must be deliver'd to them.</text>
<text id="2000004">To this end, I am at thy side.</text>
<text id="2000100">Welcome home, ashen one.</text>
<text id="2000101">Speak thine heart's desire.</text>
<text id="2000200">Very well.</text>
<text id="2000201">Then touch the darkness within me.</text>
<text id="2000202">Take nourishment from these sovereignless souls.</text>
<text id="2000300">Let these souls, withdrawn from their vessels,
manifestations of disparity, elucidated by fire...</text>
<text id="2000301">...burrow deep within me,
retreating to a darkness beyond the reach of flame.</text>
<text id="2000302">Let them assume a new master, inhabiting ash,
casting themselves upon new forms.</text>
<text id="2000303">An Unkindled slayer of lords; a Lord himself Unkindled.</text>
<text id="2000353">An Unkindled slayer of lords; a Lord herself Unkindled.</text>
<text id="2000400">Farewell, ashen one.</text>
<text id="2000401">May the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="2000500">Farewell, ashen one.</text>
<text id="2000501">Mayst thou thy peace discov'r.</text>
<text id="2000600">Ashen one, to be unkindled is to be a vessel for souls.</text>
<text id="2000601">Sovereignless souls will become thy strength.</text>
<text id="2000602">I will show thee how.</text>
<text id="2000603">Ashen one, bring me souls, plucked from their vessels...</text>
<text id="2000700">Ashen one, may I pose thee a question?</text>
<text id="2000701">Has the little Lord Ludleth spoken to thee of any...curious matters?</text>
<text id="2000702">I sense that he possesseth some knowledge...</text>
<text id="2000703">Of a thing once most precious, or most terrible, now lost to the Fire Keepers.</text>
<text id="2000704">Pray tell, is it a matter of which I should be apprised?</text>
<text id="2000800">Ashen one, my thanks for the eyes thou'st given.</text>
<text id="2000801">But Fire Keepers are not meant to have eyes. It is forbidden.</text>
<text id="2000802">These will reveal, through a sliver of light, frightful images of betrayal.</text>
<text id="2000803">A world without fire.</text>
<text id="2000804">Ashen one, is this truly thy wish?</text>
<text id="2000900">Of course.</text>
<text id="2000901">I serve thee, and will do as thou bid'st.</text>
<text id="2000902">This will be our private affair. No one else may know of this.</text>
<text id="2000903">Stay thy path, find lords to link the fire, and I will blindly tend to the flame.</text>
<text id="2000904">Until the day of thy grand betrayal.</text>
<text id="2001000">Ashen one, if thine heart should bend...</text>
<text id="2001001">...kill me, and strip these eyes from my person.</text>
<text id="2001002">I will return as the Fire Keeper I once was.</text>
<text id="2001003">As it always has been.</text>
<text id="2001100">Of course not.</text>
<text id="2001101">Please, kill me, and take these eyes away.</text>
<text id="2001102">Before I am drawn into the darkness.</text>
<text id="2001103">Seduced by the thin light, and the awful betrayal...</text>
<text id="2001200">Ashen one, kill me, and take these eyes away.</text>
<text id="2001201">Before I am drawn into the darkness.</text>
<text id="2001202">Seduced by the thin light, and the awful betrayal...</text>
<text id="2001300">The five lords sit their five thrones.</text>
<text id="2001301">All thanks to thee, most worthy of lords.</text>
<text id="2001302">Ashen one, with the Lords as thy witness, bend thy knee afore the bonfire's coiled sword.</text>
<text id="2001303">And let the Lords' embers acknowledge thee as their true heir.</text>
<text id="2001304">A true lord, fit to link the fire.</text>
<text id="2001400">Ashen one, with the Lords as thy witness, bend thy knee afore the bonfire's coiled sword.</text>
<text id="2001401">And let the Lords' embers acknowledge thee as their true heir.</text>
<text id="2001402">A true lord, fit to link the fire.</text>
<text id="2001500">Noble Lords of Cinder.</text>
<text id="2001600">The fire fades...</text>
<text id="2001601">...and the lords go without thrones.</text>
<text id="2001700">Surrender your fires...</text>
<text id="2001701">...to the true heir.</text>
<text id="2001800">Let him grant death...</text>
<text id="2001801">Let her grant death...</text>
<text id="2001802">To the old gods of Lordran, deliverers of the First Flame.</text>
<text id="2001900">Ashen one, forgive me if this soundeth strange.</text>
<text id="2001901">The eyes show a world without fire, a vast stretch of darkness.</text>
<text id="2001902">But 'tis different to what is seen when stripped of vision.</text>
<text id="2001903">In the far distance, I sense the presence of tiny flames.</text>
<text id="2001904">Like precious embers, left to us by past Lords, linkers of the fire.</text>
<text id="2001905">Could this be what draws me to this strangely enticing darkness?</text>
<text id="2002000">Ashen one, link the fire.</text>
<text id="2002001">For the Lords of Cinder, for the ashen prisoners,
for all those held to preserve the fire.</text>
<text id="2002002">Link the First Flame.</text>
<text id="2002100">Ashen one, may the flames guide thee.</text>
<text id="2002200">Ashen one, if, when thou peerest upon the First Flame...</text>
<text id="2002201">...Thou wishest yet, for a world without fire, for an end to the linking of the fire...</text>
<text id="2002202">Then call upon me.</text>
<text id="2002203">I am a Fire Keeper, and I tend to the flame, to the very end.</text>
<text id="2002204">Thou'st given me eyes, and such it was they shewed me.</text>
<text id="2002300">Mayst thou thy peace discov'r.</text>
<text id="2002400">The First Flame quickly fades.</text>
<text id="2002401">Darkness will shortly settle.</text>
<text id="2002402">But one day, tiny flames will dance across the darkness.</text>
<text id="2002403">Like embers, linked by lords past.</text>
<text id="2002500">Ashen one, hearest thou my voice, still?</text>
<text id="2002600"></text>
<text id="2002601"></text>
<text id="2002602"></text>
<text id="2002700"></text>
<text id="2002701"></text>
<text id="2002702">Ashen one, what is wrong?</text>
<text id="2002800">Ashen one, was it all a lie?</text>
<text id="2002801">But why, ashen one...</text>
<text id="2002802">Great lord of dark...</text>
<text id="2002900">I'm truly sorry.</text>
<text id="2002901">But, know'st thou not? I cannot die.</text>
<text id="2002902">So please, ashen one, allow me to serve thee.</text>
<text id="2002903">The Lords have left their thrones, and must be delivered to them.</text>
<text id="2002904">To this end, I am ever at thy side.</text>
<text id="2003000">Ashen one.</text>
<text id="2003001">Produce the coiled sword at the bonfire.</text>
<text id="2003002">The mark of ash will guide thee to the land of the Lords.</text>
<text id="2003003">To Lothric, where the homes of the Lords converge.</text>
<text id="2003100">...Ashen one, are these...</text>
<text id="2003101">...are these eyes?</text>
<text id="2003102">How gracious of thee, ashen one.</text>
<text id="2003103">The very things we Fire Keepers have been missing...</text>
<text id="2003200">...Ashen one, this is...</text>
<text id="2003201">...much like what lies within me...</text>
<text id="2003202">Then let it find its own place, within my bosom.</text>
<text id="2003203">She will understand. We are both Fire Keepers, after all.</text>
<text id="2003300">Forgive me, sister.</text>
<text id="2003301">May the flames guide thy way.</text>
<text id="3000000">Oh, thou'rt unkindled, and a seeker of Lords.</text>
<text id="3000001">I am Ludleth of Courland.</text>
<text id="3000002">Look not in bewilderment as I say...I linked the fire long ago, becoming a Lord of Cinder.</text>
<text id="3000003">If substantiation be thy want, set thine eyes upon my charred corse.</text>
<text id="3000004">This sad cadav'r. No need to be coy, have a closer look.</text>
<text id="3000005">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000100">Fret not, fret not, my feet are here firmly planted.</text>
<text id="3000101">For I am a Lord, and this is my throne.</text>
<text id="3000102">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000200">Ahh, beg pardon. I must have dozed a while.</text>
<text id="3000201">Fret not, fret not, my feet are here firmly planted.</text>
<text id="3000202">For I am a Lord, and this is my throne.</text>
<text id="3000203">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000300">Ah-hah, thou'rt returned. And a fine day it is.</text>
<text id="3000301">So, happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3000400">Ahh, beg pardon. I must have dozed a while.</text>
<text id="3000401">So, happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3000500">Ahh, well met. All is as planned, is it not?</text>
<text id="3000501">Five lords for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3000502">Glory be, my Lord-slaying Champion. It is all thy doing.</text>
<text id="3000503">The stage is set for me to play my part as Lord, too.</text>
<text id="3000504">Go. Speak with the Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3000505">She awaiteth thee.</text>
<text id="3000506">...She hath waited a long time indeed...</text>
<text id="3000507">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000600">Now, now, do not be away overlong.</text>
<text id="3000601">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000700">Knowest thou of our purpose?</text>
<text id="3000701">Five thrones will take five Lords, as kindling for the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="3000702">The fast-fading flame must be linked, to preserve this world.</text>
<text id="3000703">A re-enactment of the first linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="3000704">So it is I became a Lord of Cinder.</text>
<text id="3000705">I may be but small, but I will die a colossus.</text>
<text id="3000706">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000800">Listen, this might pique thine interest.</text>
<text id="3000801">Before I was a Lord of Cinder, I was a student of transposition.</text>
<text id="3000802">The process of extracting, and coalescing, the essence of a soul.</text>
<text id="3000803">A forbidden art, that once left a foul stain upon Courland's honour.</text>
<text id="3000804">Tis an art that grants powers once thought unattainable.</text>
<text id="3000805">Most transposing kilns were lost with Courland, but this place is a crossing for all manner of cursed objects.</text>
<text id="3000806">If thou happen'st 'pon a transposing kiln, bring it to me, quick.</text>
<text id="3000807">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000900">Ahh, most illustrious Lordseeker. Or should I say, Lord-slayer?</text>
<text id="3000901">Fine kindling for the thrones, is it not, each soul truly worthy of Lordship.</text>
<text id="3000902">And all slain by thy hand. To bind them to their thrones, even in death.</text>
<text id="3000903">Oh, I have no qualms. For as we are to our thrones, thou art to thy duty.</text>
<text id="3000904">In fact, methinks thou'st helped these poor Lords along their rightful path.</text>
<text id="3000905"></text>
<text id="3000906">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001000">Oh, belike it is...a transposing kiln in thy possession.</text>
<text id="3001001">Seen better days, but, methinks it shall suffice.</text>
<text id="3001002">Now, bring to me a twisted soul.</text>
<text id="3001003">Transposition is the art of extracting, and coalescing, the essence of a soul.</text>
<text id="3001004">In transposing a twisted soul, its true power transferreth to thee.</text>
<text id="3001005">Thy purpose is to seek Lords, and slay them. What's to fear in a little transposition, now?</text>
<text id="3001006">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001100">See ye not? I am a Lord...</text>
<text id="3001101">A wee flame, belike, but I shoulder the world...</text>
<text id="3001102">Forgive me. Oh, please...</text>
<text id="3001103">I am not to blame, I'm not...</text>
<text id="3001200">Ahh, it singeth, to the bone, it hurts...</text>
<text id="3001201">Please, help me. Be done with me...</text>
<text id="3001202">No, gods, no, I cannot bear it...</text>
<text id="3001203">It burns, burns, help me...</text>
<text id="3001300"></text>
<text id="3001301"></text>
<text id="3001302"></text>
<text id="3001400"></text>
<text id="3001401"></text>
<text id="3001402">Lord-slayer, do not fail us now...</text>
<text id="3001403">Five Lords, for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3001500">Ahh, found her, did we?</text>
<text id="3001501">And the black eyes that shimmer within, I see?</text>
<text id="3001502">Tis as if it were but yesterday.</text>
<text id="3001503">We did all we could to spare her from them.</text>
<text id="3001504">Much has happened since.</text>
<text id="3001505">Mayhap I should apprise thee...</text>
<text id="3001506">Of what the thin light of these eyes might reveal, to the eyeless Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3001507">Scenes of betrayal, things never intended for her ken, visions of...</text>
<text id="3001508">...this age's end...</text>
<text id="3001509">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001600">Well well, what peculiar things thou keep'st on thy person...</text>
<text id="3001601">Those I have seen before. Black eyes, if I am not mistaken?</text>
<text id="3001700">Ahh, well met. Thou'rt at last returned.</text>
<text id="3001701">Knowest thou the name, Anri of Astora?</text>
<text id="3001702">The brave girl left this, as thanks.</text>
<text id="3001703">The brave lad left this, as thanks.</text>
<text id="3001704">Though gave no elucidation...</text>
<text id="3001705">So. Happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3001800">Ahh, well met. All is as planned, is it not?</text>
<text id="3001801">Five lords for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3001802">To think others might ne'er be raised...</text>
<text id="3001803">And I, of the Last Lords, a rather little lord, most undeserving of the honour.</text>
<text id="3001804"></text>
<text id="3001805">Speak with the Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3001806">She awaiteth thee.</text>
<text id="3001807">...She hath waited a long time indeed...</text>
<text id="3001900">Treat the Fire Keeper not with discourtesy.</text>
<text id="3001901">She is much like thee. Prisoners, both, kept to link the fire.</text>
<text id="3001902">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002000">I took the mantle of Lord of Cinder of mine own volition. I speak these words with pride.</text>
<text id="3002001">Choose thy fate alone. Seize it with thine own hands.</text>
<text id="3002002">All the more, should thy fate entail such foul betrayal... </text>
<text id="3002003">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002100">Now, heed this little warning, from this little lord.</text>
<text id="3002101">Seek not the girl.</text>
<text id="3002102">Seek not the boy.</text>
<text id="3002103">She knoweth her fate. What will become of her upon her duty's end.</text>
<text id="3002104">She would not wish thee follow her.</text>
<text id="3002105">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002153">He knoweth his fate. What will become of him upon his duty's end.</text>
<text id="3002154">He would not wish thee follow him.</text>
<text id="3002200">The eyes shew a world destitute of fire, a barren plane of endless darkness.</text>
<text id="3002201">A place born of betrayal.</text>
<text id="3002202">So I will'd myself Lord, to link the fire, to paint a new vision.</text>
<text id="3002203">What is thine intent?</text>
<text id="3002204">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002300">Ahh, thou'st two most peculiar swords discover'd.</text>
<text id="3002301">A curse once bound them together, such that they served as one.</text>
<text id="3002302">A transposing kiln should restore their rightful form.</text>
<text id="3002303">But before thou should'st act, think well upon the matter.</text>
<text id="3002304">As thou knowest, they are but newly rent apart.</text>
<text id="3002400">Don't Kill me.... Leave me Alone...</text>
<text id="3002500">Are you the ashenone? </text>
<text id="3002501">Lothric is a place of killing! The princes! They got mad! </text>
<text id="3002600">Juse let me hide here.. </text>
<text id="4000000">...Oh, prithee...art thou good Yoel's master?</text>
<text id="4000001">I am Yuria of Londor, a close friend of his.</text>
<text id="4000002">Thanks to thee, Yoel's soul is redeem'd.</text>
<text id="4000003">Allow me to express my gratitude, in his stead.</text>
<text id="4000004">Another matter.</text>
<text id="4000005">Thou'rt a Lord, art thou not?</text>
<text id="4000006">Bearer of the dark sigil, and our Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4000007">For the time thou remain'st our Lord, we of Londor shall serve thee.</text>
<text id="4000008">And I, of course, am also thine.</text>
<text id="4000100">Speak thy desire,</text>
<text id="4000101">honourable Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4000200">Ahh, our Lord and rightful Liege.</text>
<text id="4000201">Speak freely, Thy Lordship. I am at thy beck and call.</text>
<text id="4000300">Away to link the fire, I presume?</text>
<text id="4000301">Think not on thy fears. The dark sigil will guide thee. </text>
<text id="4000302">Link the fire, our Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4000400">Ahh, our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4000401">Thine heart is fix'd upon the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="4000402">But brave usurper, I prithee, wrest the flame from its mantle.</text>
<text id="4000403">So that we Hollows, in most honest shape of man, may have it for our own.</text>
<text id="4000500">Till we meet again.</text>
<text id="4000501">May the dark sigil guide thee.</text>
<text id="4000600">Be safe, our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4000601">I prithee wrest the flame from its mantle.</text>
<text id="4000700">Link the fire, our Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4000800">Honourable usurper, I prithee wrest the flame from its mantle.</text>
<text id="4000801">So that we Hollows, in most honest shape of man, may have it for our own.</text>
<text id="4000900">Good Hollow, I prithee reflect on this knowledge.</text>
<text id="4000901">On the nature of the Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4000902">The Lord of Hollows shall o'erthrow the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="4000903">The Age of Fire was founded by the old gods, sustained by the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="4000904">But the gods are no longer, and the all-powerful fire deserveth a new heir.</text>
<text id="4000905">Our Lord of Hollows, perchance, who dons the true mask of mankind.</text>
<text id="4001000">Oh, good Hollow. I'm afraid I must say...</text>
<text id="4001001">Orbeck of Vinheim is a cause of much consternation.</text>
<text id="4001002">He proclaimeth himself Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4001003">If left alone, he may one day imperil thy rule.</text>
<text id="4001004">Fall to this matter yarely, else we are unraveled.</text>
<text id="4001005">Decisiveness is the mark of a true monarch...</text>
<text id="4001100">Orbeck of Vinheim is a cause of much consternation.</text>
<text id="4001101">If left alone, he may one day imperil thy rule.</text>
<text id="4001102">Fall to this matter yarely, else we are unraveled.</text>
<text id="4001200">Our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4001201">Knowest thou of a maid named Anri?</text>
<text id="4001202">Knowest thou of a youth named Anri?</text>
<text id="4001203">She is Hollow, and will join thee in wedlock.</text>
<text id="4001204">A fellow of mine guides her at this moment. When the time is ripe, thou mayst make thy salutations.</text>
<text id="4001205">A fellow of mine guides him at this moment. When the time is ripe, thou mayst make thy salutations.</text>
<text id="4001206">For what Lord taketh no spouse?</text>
<text id="4001253">He is Hollow, and will join thee in wedlock.</text>
<text id="4001300">Ahh, greetings, our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4001301">Good tidings. Thy spouse is ready.</text>
<text id="4001302">The time is ripe to greet her.</text>
<text id="4001303">The girl awaits thee, in the hidden darkmoon chamber of Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="4001304">The boy awaits thee, in the hidden darkmoon chamber of Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="4001305">So thou mayst a true monarch become.</text>
<text id="4001352">The time is ripe to greet him.</text>
<text id="4001400">Ahh, I see Orbeck's claim is proven false.</text>
<text id="4001401">As it should be, our right and deserving Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4001402">It is a Londor treasure, befitting of a true Lord.</text>
<text id="4001403">Lord of Hollows, may the dark sigil guide thy way.</text>
<text id="4001500">Ahh, our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4001501">I presume thy holy vows are sworn?</text>
<text id="4001502">Wonderful. Now thou'rt the true and deserving Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="4001503">With a spouse, the strength to claim the fire is thine.</text>
<text id="4001504">Thy Lordship, I prithee wrest the fire from its mantle.</text>
<text id="4001505">I, Yuria, and all Londor, embrace thy impending Lordship.</text>
<text id="4001600">Thou'st forsworn the Lord's Mark.</text>
<text id="4001601">There is naught more to say.</text>
<text id="4001602">Farewell, our fleeting Lord.</text>
<text id="4001700"></text>
<text id="4001701"></text>
<text id="4001702"></text>
<text id="4001703">Where are thy wits!</text>
<text id="4001704">Cease this at once!</text>
<text id="4001800">Hmph, Yoel knows not of thy folly.</text>
<text id="4001801">A Hollow need not be mad.</text>
<text id="4001802">No one so weak shall ever rule us!</text>
<text id="4001803"></text>
<text id="4001804"></text>
<text id="4001900"></text>
<text id="4001901"></text>
<text id="4001902">So, these are the shackles of the gods...</text>
<text id="4001903">Kaathe, I have failed thee...</text>
<text id="4002000">Peasant, at least thy cadavder shall a little kindling make...</text>
<text id="4002100"></text>
<text id="4002101"></text>
<text id="4002102"></text>
<text id="4002103">Thy Lordship, what is the matter?</text>
<text id="4002104">Please, stop.</text>
<text id="4002200"></text>
<text id="4002201"></text>
<text id="4002202">Brave usurper, I beseech thee claim the fire...</text>
<text id="4002203">Be our Lord of Hollows...</text>
<text id="4002300">Our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4002301">I prithee play the usurper.</text>
<text id="4002302">When the moment cometh to link the fire, wrest it from its mantle.</text>
<text id="4002303">The Age of Fire was founded by the old gods, sustained by the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="4002304">But the gods are no more, and the all-powerful fire deserveth a new heir.</text>
<text id="4002305">Our Lord of Hollows, it shall be, who weareth the true face of mankind.</text>
<text id="5000000"></text>
<text id="5000001">Please, grant me death. Undo my shackles.</text>
<text id="5000002"></text>
<text id="5000100">Ohh...</text>
<text id="5000101">Ohh, then it's true...</text>
<text id="5000102">A Champion of Ash, as I live and breathe.</text>
<text id="5000103">To be in your presence is a great honour.</text>
<text id="5000104">I am Yoel of Londor, a pilgrim, as you can see, only...</text>
<text id="5000105">Somehow, I've failed to die as was ordained.</text>
<text id="5000106">Well, perhaps my calling lies elsewhere.</text>
<text id="5000107">Say, Champion of Ash, how does the idea of taking me into your service strike you?</text>
<text id="5000108">I was once a sorcerer. Surely I can be of use.</text>
<text id="5000200">Ohh, I am honoured, truly.</text>
<text id="5000201">I should be dead, yet you have granted me purpose anew.</text>
<text id="5000202">I, Yoel of Londor, do solemnly swear myself to you.</text>
<text id="5000300">Ahh, mm, yes, of course.</text>
<text id="5000301">An accursed pilgrim has no place in your honourable service.</text>
<text id="5000302">But if a lost soul should encounter a legend such as you,</text>
<text id="5000303">could that be anything but a movement of fate?</text>
<text id="5000304">I will remain in this spot.</text>
<text id="5000305">Praying solemnly that you might have a change of heart.</text>
<text id="5000400">Ahh, Champion of Ash. Have you had a change of heart?</text>
<text id="5000401">I beg of you, take me into your service.</text>
<text id="5000500"></text>
<text id="5000501"></text>
<text id="5000502"></text>
<text id="5000503">What's come over you!</text>
<text id="5000600"></text>
<text id="5000601"></text>
<text id="5000602">Killing Undead for sport, accursed champion?</text>
<text id="5000603">And a fool's sport it is...</text>
<text id="5000700">Oh, our Champion of Ash, welcome home.</text>
<text id="5000701">This pilgrim, with a debt in death, hardly deserves to behold this divine flame.</text>
<text id="5000702">And I never would have, had you not taken me into your service.</text>
<text id="5000703">I thank you dearly for this... And assure you of my leal service.</text>
<text id="5000800">Oh, our Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="5000801">By all means, tell me what you desire.</text>
<text id="5000900">Oh, our Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="5000901">I would do anything for my master, just say the word.</text>
<text id="5001000">Be safe, Champion of Ash.</text>
<text id="5001100">Be safe, our Lord...</text>
<text id="5001200">As I have said, I was once a sorcerer.</text>
<text id="5001201">Alas, the magic of Londor is a far cry from the wonders of Vinheim.</text>
<text id="5001202">But I can teach you what I know.</text>
<text id="5001203">Perhaps more importantly...</text>
<text id="5001204">I believe that I can help tease out your true strength.</text>
<text id="5001205">We pilgrims of Londor are keenly aware.</text>
<text id="5001206">That those branded by the Darksign possess something quite special...</text>
<text id="5001300">Then, shall we begin?</text>
<text id="5001301">Bearer of the Darksign, let your true strength shine...</text>
<text id="5001400">Ahh, you have attained ample strength.</text>
<text id="5001401">All will soon be clear, my good Lord...</text>
<text id="5001500"></text>
<text id="5001501"></text>
<text id="5001502"></text>
<text id="5001503">What do you intend?</text>
<text id="5001600"></text>
<text id="5001601"></text>
<text id="5001602">Champion of ash, what have you done?</text>
<text id="5001603">Lady Yuria...</text>
<text id="5001700">Ahh, I thank you kindly...</text>
<text id="5001701">Our kindest Lord...</text>
<text id="6000000">Name thyself, stranger.</text>
<text id="6000001">I am Yorshka. Captain of the Darkmoon Knights.</text>
<text id="6000002">What beckoned thee to such a place?</text>
<text id="6000100">Thou think'st to-</text>
<text id="6000101">Very well. Captain to this knightless company, I remain.</text>
<text id="6000102">I will grant thee purpose.</text>
<text id="6000103">Thou'st journeyed far; hear my voice.</text>
<text id="6000104">If thou shalt swear by the Covenant, to become</text>
<text id="6000105">A shadow of Father Gwyn and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="6000106">A blade that shall hunt the foes of our Lords;</text>
<text id="6000107">Then I place thee under the aegis, and the power, of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="6000108">Thou'rt now a Blade of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="6000109">The only knight of our company.</text>
<text id="6000110">Swear this oath, and face thy solemn duty.</text>
<text id="6000200">If thou'st come stumbling here in error, I bid thee leave anon.</text>
<text id="6000201">This tower is a prison. Thy presence shall invoke the ire of the tyrant, Sulyvahn.</text>
<text id="6000202">Though 'twas a rare delight to converse with another. My thanks, strange visitor.</text>
<text id="6000203">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text id="6000300">Thou think'st to remain?</text>
<text id="6000301">This tower is a prison. Thy presence shall invoke the ire of the tyrant, Sulyvahn.</text>
<text id="6000302">I bid thee leave, anon.</text>
<text id="6000303">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text id="6000400">Thou art return'd?</text>
<text id="6000401">This tower is a prison. Thy presence shall invoke the ire of the tyrant, Sulyvahn.</text>
<text id="6000402">I bid thee leave, anon.</text>
<text id="6000403">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text id="6000500">Oh, good Blade of the Darkmoon, welcome home.</text>
<text id="6000501">If I can provide thee succour, only tell me how.</text>
<text id="6000600">Off so soon?</text>
<text id="6000601">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text id="6000700">Long ago, our father Gwyn, lamenting the waning of the fire, became cinder of his own will.</text>
<text id="6000701">Now, the fire is linked by the champions who have come in his stead.</text>
<text id="6000702">Such is the will of father, and the gods. And so the Darkmoon knights took arms, to watch over those who link the fire.</text>
<text id="6000703">But long ago, our company lost its last proper knight.</text>
<text id="6000704">Only its covenant was preserved, to this day, until the time of thy visit.</text>
<text id="6000705">Heirdom taketh many forms, indeed.</text>
<text id="6000800">May I pose thee a question?</text>
<text id="6000801">This tower, this prison, stands tall and solitary, the contraption bridging its lower reaches long unmoving.</text>
<text id="6000802">So...by what path didst thou here ascend?</text>
<text id="6000803">Art thou a creature of the air, or other winged thing?</text>
<text id="6000900">Oh, my! I imagined it might be so.</text>
<text id="6000901">Then thou'rt a dragon, or perhaps a crow?</text>
<text id="6000902">Well, whatever thou beest, thou'rt wondrous strange, yet strangely familiar, visitor.</text>
<text id="6000903"></text>
<text id="6001000">No, of course not.</text>
<text id="6001001">Forgive my prying. Think no more on mine asking.</text>
<text id="6001002">I am ashamed to say, I know very little, of anything...</text>
<text id="6001100">The Darkmoon Knights were once led by my elder brother, the Dark Sun Gwyndolin.</text>
<text id="6001101">But he was stricken by illness, and leadership of the knights fell to me.</text>
<text id="6001102">Then Sulyvahn wrongfully proclaimed himself Pontiff, and took me prisoner.</text>
<text id="6001103">Oh where could my dear brother be?</text>
<text id="6001104">If only he were here, I would be most pleased for ye both to meet.</text>
<text id="6001105">As, most assuredly, would he.</text>
<text id="6001106"></text>
<text id="6001200">Oh, this is...my brother's...finger.</text>
<text id="6001201">How it has thinned and withered...</text>
<text id="6001300">Oh, my thanks. I'm certain thou'st given my brother peace.</text>
<text id="6001301">It is not much, but take this ring.</text>
<text id="6001302">It is not much, but please take this.</text>
<text id="6001303">As my thanks, not as a captain, but as sister to the Dark Sun Gwyndolin.</text>
<text id="6001304">...Thou'st granted me my brother's touch, one last time...</text>
<text id="6001400"></text>
<text id="6001401"></text>
<text id="6001402"></text>
<text id="6001500"></text>
<text id="6001501"></text>
<text id="6001502">Dear brother, forgive me...</text>
<text id="6001503">There is no one left...</text>
<text id="6001600"></text>
<text id="6001601"></text>
<text id="6001602"></text>
<text id="6001603">Please, stop this!</text>
<text id="6001604">Thou'rt no true knight!</text>
<text id="6001700"></text>
<text id="6001701"></text>
<text id="6001702">Dear brother, forgive me...</text>
<text id="6001703">I have been deceived...</text>
<text id="6001704">This man is a grave threat...</text>
<text id="6001705">This woman is a grave threat...</text>
<text id="6001800">My Blade of the Darkmoon, thy deeds merit great worship.</text>
<text id="6001801">As Captain, 'tis my duty to honour knights of great accomplishment.</text>
<text id="6001802">This is a wonder of the Darkmoon, inherited from my brother for this very purpose.</text>
<text id="6001803">Please, it is thine, and not lightly given.</text>
<text id="6001804">As a shade of Father Gwyn and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="6001805">Persevere in thy knightly duty, hunting down the gods' would-be foes.</text>
<text id="6001900">My Blade of the Darkmoon, thy deeds merit great worship.</text>
<text id="6001901">I, Yorshka, captain of this company, hereby recognise thy service.</text>
<text id="6001902">Please, take this. Thou'rt most deserving of it.</text>
<text id="6001903">As a shade of Father Gwyn and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="6001904">Persevere in thy knightly duty, hunting down the gods' would-be foes.</text>
<text id="6001905">...I would speak to my brother of this, one day. Of the shining new hope that joined our dear company.</text>
<text id="6001906">I speak of thee, of course.</text>
<text id="6001907"></text>
<text id="7000000">Ahhh, another one, roused from the sleep of death?</text>
<text id="7000001">Well, you're not alone. We Unkindled are worthless. Can't even die right.</text>
<text id="7000002">Gives me conniptions.</text>
<text id="7000003">And they'd have us seek the Lords of Cinder, and return them to their moulding thrones.</text>
<text id="7000004">But we're talking true legends with the mettle to link the fire. We're not fit to lick their boots.</text>
<text id="7000005">Don't you think?</text>
<text id="7000006"></text>
<text id="7000100">What a sick joke.</text>
<text id="7000101">Asking us to seek the Lords of Cinder, and return them to their moulding thrones.</text>
<text id="7000102">We're talking true legends, those who would link the fire. We're not fit to lick their boots.</text>
<text id="7000103"></text>
<text id="7000200">Oooh, yet to give in, eh?</text>
<text id="7000201">Good. The Fire Keeper must be twitching with delight.</text>
<text id="7000202">But what do you really know about these Lords of Cinder, these supposed legends?</text>
<text id="7000203">Let's take Aldrich, for one.</text>
<text id="7000204">A right and proper cleric, only, he developed a habit of devouring men.</text>
<text id="7000205">He ate so many that he bloated like a drowned pig, then softened into sludge, so they stuck him in the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="7000206">And they made him a Lord of Cinder. Not for virtue, but for might.</text>
<text id="7000207">Such is a lord, I suppose. But here I ask. Do we have a sodding chance?</text>
<text id="7000208"></text>
<text id="7000300">At the foot of Lothric Castle, an old path still runs below the tower in the Undead Settlement.</text>
<text id="7000301">It was used to transport sacrifices to the Cathedral of the Deep. You should see where it leads.</text>
<text id="7000302">...If you've the stones for it.</text>
<text id="7000303"></text>
<text id="7000400">You haven't given up yet? Then you're a brasher lad than I thought.</text>
<text id="7000401">You haven't given up yet? Then you're a brasher lass than I thought.</text>
<text id="7000402">You can make better use of this.</text>
<text id="7000403">A medallion to gain entry to the keep of the Undead Legion of Farron, Lords of Cinder in their own right.</text>
<text id="7000404">I don't need it. Not now I've flown the coop.</text>
<text id="7000405"></text>
<text id="7000500">The Undead Legion of Farron is a caravan of Undead.</text>
<text id="7000501">Sworn by wolf's blood to contain the Abyss, the Legion will bury a kingdom at the first sign of exposure.</text>
<text id="7000502">Joyous bunch, really.</text>
<text id="7000503">Gaining admission to the Legion is a matter of some ceremony.</text>
<text id="7000504">Inside their keep, snuffing out the flames of three altars opens the door to the wolf blood.</text>
<text id="7000505">Inside their keep, snuffing out the flames of four altars opens the door to the wolf blood.</text>
<text id="7000506">Even accursed Undead want to believe they're special, it seems.</text>
<text id="7000507">I pity the sorry souls.</text>
<text id="7000508"></text>
<text id="7000600">Gaining admission to the Legion is a matter of some ceremony.</text>
<text id="7000601">Inside their keep, snuffing out the flames of three altars opens the door to the wolf blood.</text>

<text id="7001000">Ah, I failed to thank you.</text>
<text id="7001001">For helping them find their final resting place...</text>
<text id="7001100">Ahh, I should've known.</text>
<text id="7001101">Well, I've decided to stop running from my fate.</text>

<text id="9001700">No one will despoil her soul.</text>
<text id="9001701">Certainly no beast wrapped in human skin!</text>
<text id="9001800">What do you want with her soul?</text>
<text id="9001801">Isn't flesh enough for a sick beast!</text>

<text id="9001902">You are a vile, rapacious beast...</text>
<text id="9001903">I should have never let you near her...</text>

<text id="9002000">Enough with you, my friend.</text>

<text id="9002102"></text>
<text id="9002103">What's wrong with you?</text>
<text id="9002104">Can you even hear me? If you can, cease this at once.</text>
<text id="9002105">Before it's too late.</text>
<text id="9002200">I see, I see, as clear as day.</text>
<text id="9002201">You are a vile, starved beast.</text>
<text id="9002202">Much too dangerous for her!</text>
<text id="9002203"></text>
<text id="9002204"></text>
<text id="9002300"></text>
<text id="9002301"></text>
<text id="9002302">Curses, I can't...die here...</text>
<text id="9002303">My dear Goddess...</text>
<text id="9002400">You beast. You've trifled with the wrong knight.</text>
<text id="9002401"></text>
<text id="9002500">You are unbecoming of a Finger.</text>
<text id="9002501">Neither she, nor I, will have you, vile beast...</text>
<text id="10000000">Well, a newcomer I see.</text>
<text id="10000001">I am Andre. I serve at this shrine.</text>
<text id="10000002">As a humble smith, forging weapons.</text>
<text id="10000003">You're in search of the Lords of Cinder, I trust?</text>
<text id="10000004">A toilsome journey I'd wager. You'll require good arms.</text>
<text id="10000005">Let me smith y' weapons.</text>
<text id="10000006">I am a smith, such is my purpose.</text>
<text id="10000100">Ahh, well met.</text>
<text id="10000101">Tis good to see y' in good health.</text>
<text id="10000102">What needs smithing this day?</text>
<text id="10000200"></text>
<text id="10000201"></text>
<text id="10000202"></text>
<text id="10000300">Prithee, be careful.</text>
<text id="10000301">I don't want to see m' work squandered!</text>
<text id="10000302"></text>
<text id="10000400">Weapons and protection are sturdy enough, by and large.</text>
<text id="10000401">But when overused, they'll eventually break.</text>
<text id="10000402">When their durability is low, repair becomes a necessity.</text>
<text id="10000403">Use a powder, or simply rest at a bonfire.</text>
<text id="10000404">But should chance impel them break, bring them me.</text>
<text id="10000405">I'll hammer 'em back into shape.</text>
<text id="10000406">They take no pleasure in breaking, I assure y'.</text>
<text id="10000407">So, handle them with care, if y' would.</text>
<text id="10000500">There are two ways to smith weapons.</text>
<text id="10000501">Simple reinforcement is one, and infusion the other.</text>
<text id="10000502">Reinforcement is straight forward. It strengthens a weapon without altering its property.</text>
<text id="10000503">Infusion is a more advanced form of smithing that infuses an element.</text>
<text id="10000504">Reinforcement requires titanite, and infusion requires gems.</text>
<text id="10000505">Bring the stones, and I'll do the smithing.</text>
<text id="10000506">It's m' purpose, after all!</text>
<text id="10000507">In battle, y' weapons are yer only friends. Forge them well, and they won't let y' down.</text>
<text id="10000600">Ahh, another matter.</text>
<text id="10000601">Infusing weapons with gems requires a special kind of coal.</text>
<text id="10000602">My humble coals won't be any use infusing more unusual gems.</text>
<text id="10000603">I know, it's an awful shame, but it's all I have.</text>
<text id="10000604">Oh, please, don't give me that look.</text>
<text id="10000605">Believe it or not, I'm quite thin-skinned.</text>
<text id="10000606"></text>
<text id="10000700">Oh, my...this coal is from the Undead Legion...</text>
<text id="10000701">Used to forge the weapons of Farron's Abyss Watchers. </text>
<text id="10000702">A fine prize. I'm honoured to be endued with it.</text>
<text id="10000703">Now I'll be equipped to infuse special gems.</text>
<text id="10000704">Praise the gods, eh. Time to put this brawn to use!</text>
<text id="10000705"></text>
<text id="10000800">My, my... The coal of that peaceable giant.</text>
<text id="10000801">Seems like ages past. I imagine his passing was long ago.</text>
<text id="10000802">I miss the old bugger, I do.</text>
<text id="10000803">My thanks. I'll be sure this coal is put to good use.</text>
<text id="10000804">I'll be smithing weapons never afore seen by the likes of y'!</text>
<text id="10000805">It's but a small service, to pay my humble respects.</text>
<text id="10000806"></text>
<text id="10000900">Lords... Where didye hap'n upon this coal?</text>
<text id="10000901">This is much too dark. I see the Abyss in it...</text>
<text id="10000902">Yet, a smith I remain. I won't turn down a request.</text>
<text id="10000903">But forget not,</text>
<text id="10000904">Your fight is for the flame, and for y' fellow kin. Just like mine.</text>
<text id="10000905">A cursed fate this may be, but hope remains, does it not?</text>
<text id="10001000">Oh, you've returned. I was hoping to see y'.</text>
<text id="10001001">That crestfallen arse Hawkwood, he handed me this.</text>
<text id="10001002">He's changed a great deal since he left this place.</text>
<text id="10001003">Graven of face, he asked me to give it y'.</text>
<text id="10001004">Well, now that that task is concluded...</text>
<text id="10001005">What would y' ha' me smith today?</text>
<text id="10001100"></text>
<text id="10001101"></text>
<text id="10001102"></text>
<text id="10001103">Enough of that!</text>
<text id="10001200"></text>
<text id="10001201"></text>
<text id="10001202">Beshrew your heart...</text>
<text id="10001300">Overstep not yer bounds, cousin.</text>
<text id="10001301">I may serve, but I'm no slave.</text>
<text id="10001302">I have business I must attend. Be gone.</text>
<text id="10001400">Oh, by the by.</text>
<text id="10001401">If you find any Estus Shards, bring 'em 'ere.</text>
<text id="10001402">They can be used to reinforce either of y' Estus Flasks.</text>
<text id="10001403">Without those flasks, you'd want for life or focus.</text>
<text id="10001404">And they'll always stay with y'. Why not treat 'em well?</text>
<text id="10001405"></text>
<text id="10001500">Well, well... What's the Undead Legion doing with a coal such as this?</text>
<text id="10001501">I'd heard one of the Crystal Sages had sided with Farron's Abyss Watchers.</text>
<text id="10001502">I suppose it must be true.</text>
<text id="10001503">You should know, this coal is imbued with magic. First one I've ever seen.</text>
<text id="10001504">Hardly a surprise is it? I've never been one for books or wise men.</text>
<text id="10001505"></text>
<text id="11000000">A pleasure to make thine acquaintance, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="11000001">Oh thou'rt...</text>
<text id="11000002">Oh, no, 'tisn't anything, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="11000003">I am but a humble handmaid of the shrine.</text>
<text id="11000004">Weapons, armour, trinkets, and spells...</text>
<text id="11000005">I've lots of little things to ease the burden of a weary traveller.</text>
<text id="11000006">...And yes, I'm Undead, too, but not so charitable as to give my goods away.</text>
<text id="11000007">Ashen One, fetch souls, and bring them to me.</text>
<text id="11000008">As is thy wont, no?</text>
<text id="11000009"></text>
<text id="11000100">Ahh, well met, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="11000101">How may I be of service?</text>
<text id="11000200">Ashen One, be sure to bring more souls.</text>
<text id="11000201"></text>
<text id="11000300">Ashen One, if my wares are not to thy satisfaction,</text>
<text id="11000301">bring me umbral ash.</text>
<text id="11000302">With ash, I'll fashion new wares.</text>
<text id="11000303">Is it not our sorry fate, to sup on death?</text>
<text id="11000304"></text>
<text id="11000400">Gracious. Passing fine ash thou'st given.</text>
<text id="11000401">Let this ash bestow nourishment.</text>
<text id="11000402">I only hope these new wares content thee...</text>
<text id="11000403"></text>
<text id="11000500">Gracious. Passing fine ash thou'st given.</text>
<text id="11000501">And awfully warm, at that.</text>
<text id="11000502">Almost as if it had lived, mere moments ago...</text>
<text id="11000503">Oh, forgive an old woman's idle prate.</text>
<text id="11000504">I'm sure an ashen one such as thee would never indulge such base contrivances...</text>
<text id="11000505">And even temptation were to prevail...</text>
<text id="11000506">I'd overlook a little mischief if thou would'st but thy purse-strings loosen...</text>
<text id="11000507">Kee hee hee...</text>
<text id="11000508"></text>
<text id="11000600">Ashen One, what woeful umbral ash is this.</text>
<text id="11000601">This barren dust, stuff of a fool, won't yield aught.</text>
<text id="11000602">Where did'st thou happen upon the stuff? Tell me, for the sport.</text>
<text id="11000700">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="11000701">Clinging to lofty dreams in this dying world...more's the pity.</text>
<text id="11000702">It must come from one most foolish indeed.</text>
<text id="11000703">Would'st thou not agree?</text>
<text id="11000704"></text>
<text id="11000800">As the Ashen One ought be...</text>
<text id="11000801">Little time for japery, mm...</text>
<text id="11000802">(laugh)</text>
<text id="11000900"></text>
<text id="11000901"></text>
<text id="11000902">Stop that!</text>
<text id="11001000"></text>
<text id="11001001">Vile brute. I'm but a poor old woman...</text>
<text id="11001100"></text>
<text id="11001101">A malicious sort, thou art.</text>
<text id="11001102">But, marvel on. Remember well, I am Undead.</text>
<text id="11001103">Bound forever by the shrine's curse...</text>
<text id="11001104">Well, little sense in timidity now.</text>
<text id="11001105">I'll have thee for all thou'rt worth...</text>
<text id="11001106"></text>
<text id="11001107"></text>
<text id="11001200">Oh, you've picked a fine time to visit.</text>
<text id="11001201">I've just come upon some fine new wares.</text>
<text id="11001202">How is it thou seem'st privy to this knowledge?</text>
<text id="11001203"></text>
<text id="11002000">Well, fancy that. </text>
<text id="11002001">A lost lamb wandereth in, with nary a peep from the bell.</text>
<text id="11002002">Well, thou shouldst my purpose know.</text>
<text id="11002003">What can this old handmaid provide thee?</text>
<text id="11002100">Well, thou'rt exceeding lost indeed.</text>
<text id="11002101">What can this old handmaid provide thee?</text>
<text id="11002200">Best not tarry long.</text>
<text id="11002201"></text>
<text id="11002300">To skirt the curse's grasp...</text>
<text id="11002301">...tarry not for long.</text>
<text id="11002302">Tis dark for now, and not a soul stirs. But remember, fires are known to fade in quiet. </text>
<text id="11002303">Or perhaps thou'rt captive already.</text>
<text id="11002304">Like the poor girl.</text>
<text id="11002305"></text>
<text id="11002400">Knowest thou of that soppy gossip?</text>
<text id="11002401">That cordial intrusion layeth the path to embers.</text>
<text id="11002402">And so thou art in need of a soapstone, ashen one.</text>
<text id="11002403">Then thy pockets will o'erflow with souls to trade to me.</text>
<text id="11002404"></text>
<text id="11002500">Well, well, what warm umbral ash have we here.</text>
<text id="11002501">It's as if thy fate were with death entwined...</text>
<text id="11002502">But take no note of me, thy business is thine own.</text>
<text id="11002503">As by now thou surely knowest,</text>
<text id="11002504">there is little I love more than a gratuity of souls...</text>
<text id="11002505"></text>
<text id="11002506"></text>
<text id="12000000">Ahh, you're no jailer, are you?</text>
<text id="12000001">No, no, you're from far away. And judging by the bell...</text>
<text id="12000002">You must be some of that unkindled ash.</text>
<text id="12000003">Remarkable. If that's true, then I have a favour to ask.</text>
<text id="12000004">Below the High Wall is a musty little town.</text>
<text id="12000005">Not the home of any lord, just a very old settlement of Undead.</text>
<text id="12000006">An old woman, Loretta, lives there.</text>
<text id="12000007">Please give her this ring.</text>
<text id="12000008">I-I'm not asking for charity. In fa- in fact, if you do this for me...</text>
<text id="12000009">I'll be sure to repay you in kind.</text>
<text id="12000010">I-I may be a petty thief, but I've more wits than most royalty.</text>
<text id="12000011">What do you say, then?</text>
<text id="12000100">Very well. I humbly place my faith in you.</text>
<text id="12000101">I am Greirat of the Undead Settlement, and I promise to assist you.</text>
<text id="12000102">Give this ring to old Loretta at the base of the High Wall.</text>
<text id="12000103">...Do your part, and I'll do mine.</text>
<text id="12000200">Yes, well, why should you?</text>
<text id="12000201">But if you change your mind, give me a shout, eh?</text>
<text id="12000202">I-I'm only a petty thief. I've nowhere else to go.</text>
<text id="12000203">Not like there's anything calling to me out there...</text>
<text id="12000204"></text>
<text id="12000300">Oh, what have we here? Changed your mind, perhaps?</text>
<text id="12000301">You deliver the ring, and I offer my co-operation.</text>
<text id="12000302">Hardly a shabby deal, hm?</text>
<text id="12000400"></text>
<text id="12000401"></text>
<text id="12000402">What in buggery!</text>
<text id="12000403">Damn it, you've lost it, haven't you!</text>
<text id="12000500"></text>
<text id="12000501">Curses, how did this...</text>
<text id="12000502">Forgive me, dear...</text>
<text id="12000600">Oh, hello, you're back.</text>
<text id="12000601">And in one piece. Well, now it's time I do my part.</text>
<text id="12000602">Whatever trinket you need, speak up.</text>
<text id="12000603">Just don't ask me where I got them.</text>
<text id="12000604"></text>
<text id="12000700">Oh, hello, you're back.</text>
<text id="12000701">And in one piece. Well, now it's time I do my part.</text>
<text id="12000800">Oh, hello, you've come at a good time.</text>
<text id="12000801">It took some prowling, but I've finally made a score.</text>
<text id="12000802">Go on, have a gander.</text>
<text id="12000900">Oh, then, we are both safe and sound.</text>
<text id="12000901">Thank the gods for that. I don't like cutting things so close.</text>
<text id="12000902">I might've died if it wasn't for that peculiar onion knight.</text>
<text id="12000903">I might've died if it wasn't for that little knight Anri.</text>
<text id="12000904">But in the end, it all paid off.</text>
<text id="12000905">Take a good look. They're sure to be of some use.</text>
<text id="12001000">Goodbye, and stay safe.</text>
<text id="12001001">Oh, this place is a bore. What good is thievery if you've nowhere to go?</text>
<text id="12001002"></text>
<text id="12001100">Good-bye. I will leave for some time. So long for now.</text>
<text id="12001101">Do stay safe, you hear? Or my efforts will have been for naught.</text>
<text id="12001102"></text>
<text id="12001200">Do me a favour, and don't forget our promise.</text>
<text id="12001201">Give the ring to old Loretta at the base of the High Wall.</text>
<text id="12001202">A nuisance, I know, but it'll help me tie up some loose ends.</text>
<text id="12001300">Ahh, there you are. I was thinking...</text>
<text id="12001301">You know I'm a petty thief.</text>
<text id="12001302">Well, perhaps I'll go on the prowl.</text>
<text id="12001303">Everyone's dead or hollowed away anyway, right, so...</text>
<text id="12001304">I might as well fetch some weapons or treasure for you.</text>
<text id="12001305">Well, what do you say?</text>
<text id="12001400">Thank you. You will not be disappointed.</text>
<text id="12001401">Greirat the Thief was once a well-known name.</text>
<text id="12001402">Until I ended up rotting in a cell...</text>
<text id="12001403"></text>
<text id="12001404"></text>
<text id="12001500">All right, fine and well.</text>
<text id="12001501">If that's your wish, I can only obey.</text>
<text id="12001502">But, feel free to change your mind later.</text>
<text id="12001503">I wouldn't want to lose my touch...</text>
<text id="12001504"></text>
<text id="12001600">What is it? Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="12001601">I'm ready to go thieving at a moment's notice. Just give me the word.</text>
<text id="12001700">Ahh, hello, fine work, I say.</text>
<text id="12001701">Discovering Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, all in a day's work.</text>
<text id="12001702">If the tales are true, it is home to old moon-worshipping nobles, and should be packed with treasure.</text>
<text id="12001703">What do you think? Shall I go and see what I can find?</text>
<text id="12001800">Mm, a fine choice!</text>
<text id="12001801">I am Greirat, the thief. What I bring back will be worthy of that name.</text>
<text id="12001802"></text>
<text id="12001900">All right, fine and well.</text>
<text id="12001901">If that is your wish, I can only obey.</text>
<text id="12001902">But, feel free to change your mind later.</text>
<text id="12001903">I hate to leave a city of nobles ripe for the picking...</text>
<text id="12001904"></text>
<text id="12002000">What is it? Changed your mind?</text>
<text id="12002001">I'm ready to go thieving at a moment's notice. Just give me the word.</text>
<text id="12002100">You know, I was thinking...</text>
<text id="12002101">About leaving for another round of thieving.</text>
<text id="12002102">There must be something of use in Lothric Castle.</text>
<text id="12002103">I-I'm aware of the danger. That castle is a deathtrap.</text>
<text id="12002104">Not a single man has returned from the castle unscathed, even back in the day.</text>
<text id="12002105">But I don't want sit around and die a petty rat.</text>
<text id="12002106">And I consider myself your friend.</text>
<text id="12002200">Thank you, for placing your trust in me.</text>
<text id="12002201">Oh, don't you worry. I know Lothric like the back of my hand.</text>
<text id="12002202"></text>
<text id="12002300">Right, fine. You're very thoughtful, you are.</text>
<text id="12002301">But, if you change your mind, do speak up.</text>
<text id="12002302">I meant every word of what I said.</text>
<text id="12002400">Changed your mind?</text>
<text id="12002401">I hope you do. I lived a petty rat, but would rather not die as one.</text>
<text id="12002500">Heavens, she was already dead...</text>
<text id="12002501">Thank you. I-I'm not surprised, though.</text>
<text id="12002502">Hmm, almost a relief, really.</text>
<text id="12002503">You can keep the ring.</text>
<text id="12002504">As, well, a little trinket of thanks, I suppose.</text>
<text id="12002505"></text>
<text id="12002600"></text>
<text id="12002601"></text>
<text id="12002602"></text>
<text id="12002603">What's got into you?</text>
<text id="12002604">Stop that, please, stop!</text>
<text id="12002700"></text>
<text id="12002701">How could you!</text>
<text id="12002702">I've gone and run my course, haven't I?</text>
<text id="12002800">Cold piss, what the devil is it now!</text>
<text id="12002801">I get caught once, and now this!</text>
<text id="12002802">One bloody time! Curse the gods!</text>
<text id="12002803"></text>
<text id="12002900">As they say,</text>
<text id="12002901">"The cornered rat will lick the balls of a cat."</text>
<text id="12003000">You're headed for the brink, aren't you?</text>
<text id="12003001">Well, you won't drag me down.</text>
<text id="12003002">En guarde, you crusty ash bastard!</text>
<text id="12003003"></text>
<text id="12003100">Cold piss, why did it come to this...</text>
<text id="12003200">And I thought we were friends...some friends...</text>
<text id="13000000">Well, this is unexpected. I don't often have visitors.</text>
<text id="13000001">What do you want?</text>
<text id="13000002">This is my study that you've happened upon.</text>
<text id="13000003">If you haven't any business, I've reading to get back to.</text>
<text id="13000100">How intriguing.</text>
<text id="13000101"></text>
<text id="13000200">Very well.</text>
<text id="13000201">Indeed, I am a sorcerer. With plenty to share.</text>
<text id="13000202">However...</text>
<text id="13000203">What champion demands service without recompense?</text>
<text id="13000204">Clearly, you are not that sort of man.</text>
<text id="13000205">Clearly, you are not that sort of woman.</text>
<text id="13000206">So, you will make me a promise.</text>
<text id="13000207">That in exchange for my teaching, you will bring me knowledge.</text>
<text id="13000208">In the form of scrolls detailing sorcery's secrets.</text>
<text id="13000209">Well? Can you assure me of this?</text>
<text id="13000300">Very well.</text>
<text id="13000301">You are no fool. I take it you understand the weight of a promise.</text>
<text id="13000302">I am Orbeck of Vinheim.</text>
<text id="13000303">Unkindled one, I shall teach you sorceries.</text>
<text id="13000304">We will learn together, it shall be like our very own school.</text>
<text id="13000400">I can respect an honest man.</text>
<text id="13000401">I can respect an honest woman.</text>
<text id="13000402">But I've already put in more than my fair share of gratuitous service.</text>
<text id="13000403">Be on your way, then.</text>
<text id="13000404">Though you're welcome back if you change your mind.</text>
<text id="13000500">Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="13000501">If I am to teach you, you are to fetch me knowledge.</text>
<text id="13000502">In the form of scrolls detailing the secrets of sorcery.</text>
<text id="13000503">Can you make this promise?</text>
<text id="13000600">You'd better not. Sorcery is not for everyone.</text>
<text id="13000601">And should never be forced.</text>
<text id="13000602">You have your own methods. Sorcery need not be one of them.</text>
<text id="13000603">Don't let it bother you.</text>
<text id="13000604">Be on your way, then.</text>
<text id="13000605">You're Unkindled. Shouldn't you get back to your duty?</text>
<text id="13000700">Oh, I thought you'd already given up.</text>
<text id="13000701">Well, nothing has changed. You're not inclined for sorcery.</text>
<text id="13000702">It is either a natural fit, or no fit at all.</text>
<text id="13000703">Be on your way, then.</text>
<text id="13000704">You're Unkindled. Shouldn't you get back to your duty?</text>
<text id="13000800">Well, well... There's something different about you, isn't there?</text>
<text id="13000801"></text>
<text id="13000900">Yes, I see.</text>
<text id="13000901">On your way, then.</text>
<text id="13000902">This is my study, and I've plenty of reading to do.</text>
<text id="13001000">Oh, enough of you, already.</text>
<text id="13001001">Do you have business with me?</text>
<text id="13001100"></text>
<text id="13001101"></text>
<text id="13001102"></text>
<text id="13001103">What's the meaning of this?</text>
<text id="13001104">Stop while you're still ahead.</text>
<text id="13001200">Is that how it is?</text>
<text id="13001201">Then we are through and done.</text>
<text id="13001202">Enjoy your long sleep!</text>
<text id="13001203"></text>
<text id="13001300">Gods, this business never did agree with me...</text>
<text id="13001400"></text>
<text id="13001401"></text>
<text id="13001402">Curses, how could this...</text>
<text id="13001403">I've lost...my touch...</text>
<text id="13001500">Oh, I've had it with you!</text>
<text id="13001501">Not another word will come out of your mouth!</text>
<text id="13001502">Perhaps this will teach you!
That petty mischief will not go overlooked!</text>
<text id="13001600">That ought to keep you quiet...</text>
<text id="13001700">Oh, you're back, then.</text>
<text id="13001701">Again, I'm Orbeck of Vinheim, here to teach you sorceries.</text>
<text id="13001702">Let us begin with the basics. The ideal sorcerer bears the twin faces of the dragon...</text>
<text id="13001703">...Oh, you could at least act as if you're paying attention!</text>
<text id="13001704">(laugh)</text>
<text id="13001800">Back again, I see.</text>
<text id="13001801">I suppose this means that you're after sorceries?</text>
<text id="13001900">Back again, I see.</text>
<text id="13001901">Perfect timing, too. I'm in need of a diversion.</text>
<text id="13002000">Oh, what is it? Forgot something?</text>
<text id="13002001">That would be quite like you.</text>
<text id="13002002"></text>
<text id="13002100">Come again.</text>
<text id="13002200">Promise to stay safe.</text>
<text id="13002300">Don't forget what you promised.</text>
<text id="13002400">Promise to stay safe.</text>
<text id="13002401">It's been nice running our own little school.</text>
<text id="13002500">I don't mean to seem overbearing, but have you forgotten?</text>
<text id="13002501">In exchange for my sorceries, you are to bring me knowledge.</text>
<text id="13002502">In the form of scrolls detailing the secrets of sorcery.</text>
<text id="13002503">I hope you're not one to break a promise.</text>
<text id="13002600">Have you forgotten our agreement?</text>
<text id="13002601">I am starved. For sorceries.</text>
<text id="13002602">Come now, I've been charitable long enough.</text>
<text id="13002700">Oh, I have something for you.</text>
<text id="13002701">You're a fine sorcerer now, no mistake.</text>
<text id="13002702">You should have something to prove it.</text>
<text id="13002703">Go on. If I'm giving something away, you'd better well take it.</text>
<text id="13002704"></text>
<text id="13002800">How do you like gimmicks, friend?</text>
<text id="13002801">This is a sign, a cipher employed by sorcerers who use quietude to their advantage.</text>
<text id="13002802"></text>
<text id="13002803">With this, you can be sure to tell friend from foe from your very first encounter.</text>
<text id="13002804">It's a very old practice at this point...</text>
<text id="13002805">...but one that you deserve to know.</text>
<text id="13002900">It is folly to claim lives recklessly, friend. Do not be tempted.</text>
<text id="13002901">No matter the victim's stature, every killing has a consequence.</text>
<text id="13002902">Even as I bloodied my hands, I never realised this simple truth.</text>
<text id="13002903">Hmph. There I was, the very definition of a fool...</text>
<text id="13003000">In Vinheim, I was an assassin.</text>
<text id="13003001">A sorcerer only in name, a killer for hire.</text>
<text id="13003002">What a fool I was, thinking one day I would learn real sorceries.</text>
<text id="13003003">When I became Undead, I was exiled from the school.</text>
<text id="13003004">But here I am, now, exploring the depths of sorcery.</text>
<text id="13003005">All thanks to you, I might add.</text>
<text id="13003100">You've been very studious.</text>
<text id="13003101">In fact, I have nothing more to teach.</text>
<text id="13003102">Well, I suppose it's high time to call it quits.</text>
<text id="13003103">I would hate to see our agreement end sourly.</text>
<text id="13003104">Better left tucked away, as a nice memory.</text>
<text id="13003200">You are no ordinary man.</text>
<text id="13003201">You are no ordinary woman.</text>
<text id="13003202">All these sorceries, and you've mastered every one.</text>
<text id="13003203">If this were the Dragon School, you'd be...</text>
<text id="13003204">..well, overtly despised, and banished from the place.</text>
<text id="13003205">(laugh)</text>
<text id="13003206">Well, I suppose it's time I packed my bags.</text>
<text id="13003207">I would hate to see our agreement end sourly.</text>
<text id="13003208">Better left tucked away, as a pleasant memory.</text>
<text id="13003300">Oh, my... This is stupendous.</text>
<text id="13003301">Then the Undead Legion of Farron possesses sorceries quite unknown.</text>
<text id="13003302">Thank you, for upholding your end of the bargain.</text>
<text id="13003303">I doubt I ever would have made this discovery alone.</text>
<text id="13003304">Now, let us unravel the thing, so you may put these new sorceries to use.</text>
<text id="13003305"></text>
<text id="13003400">Oh, my! You've made quite the discovery!</text>
<text id="13003401">This is a scroll of the prodigious Big Hat Logan.</text>
<text id="13003402">A masterful sorcerer, long missed in Vinheim.</text>
<text id="13003403">And now, we have his scroll, right here in my very hands.</text>
<text id="13003500">Unfathomable.</text>
<text id="13003501">This is a crystal sorcery, created by the pale dragon,
thought only to exist in legend...</text>
<text id="13003502">I am ever grateful to you. This is truly sublime. </text>
<text id="13003503">I am afraid this is a debt I cannot repay, only...</text>
<text id="13003504">I will be sure to unravel it for you. Just a moment.</text>
<text id="13003600">Oh, my... This is very unusual.</text>
<text id="13003601">It's from Oolacile, an ancient land of golden sorceries.</text>
<text id="13003602">Not even the Dragon School possesses such a long-lost scroll.</text>
<text id="13003603">What would the xanthous scholars say, with their ridiculous headwear.</text>
<text id="13003604">They would simply slaver over this find.</text>
<text id="13003605">(laugh)</text>
<text id="13003700"></text>
<text id="13003701"></text>
<text id="13003702"></text>
<text id="13003703">What is this about?</text>
<text id="13003704">Have you lost your wits?</text>
<text id="13003800">Seems it's too late.</text>
<text id="13003801">Then, there's only one thing to do.</text>
<text id="13003802">With regret, I will end this here and now!</text>
<text id="13003803"></text>
<text id="13003900">Gods, what have I done...</text>
<text id="13004000">Farewell. We had a nice little school going.</text>
<text id="13004100"></text>
<text id="13004101"></text>
<text id="13004102">But, why...</text>
<text id="13004103">Is that all that I'm worth?</text>
<text id="13004200"></text>
<text id="13004201"></text>
<text id="13004202">So be it...</text>
<text id="13004203">It was nice while it lasted...</text>
<text id="14000000">Ah-hah, Unkindled are we?</text>
<text id="14000001">Welcome to my abode.</text>
<text id="14000002">I am Cornyx, an old pyromancer.</text>
<text id="14000003">A crow in his cage, as you see, now.</text>
<text id="14000004">But here we are, an encounter for the ages!</text>
<text id="14000005"></text>
<text id="14000006">I hear the Unkindled make for fine vessels.</text>
<text id="14000007">Care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?</text>
<text id="14000100"></text>
<text id="14000101">Most wise. A chance encounter should not be squandered.</text>
<text id="14000102">To reiterate, I am Cornyx, of the Great Swamp.</text>
<text id="14000103">The pleasure is mine.</text>
<text id="14000104"></text>
<text id="14000200"></text>
<text id="14000201">Most foolish. This old crow has a little knowledge of his own, you know.</text>
<text id="14000202">Bah. No sense in spelling it out.</text>
<text id="14000203">I will not rush you. You will return, once you are enlightened.</text>
<text id="14000204">We are, after all, both Undead. And both prisoners, in our own ways.</text>
<text id="14000205"></text>
<text id="14000300">Well, hello, That was certainly quick.</text>
<text id="14000301">Well, hello. You certainly took your time.</text>
<text id="14000302">Are you any more enlightened on this occasion?</text>
<text id="14000400"></text>
<text id="14000401"></text>
<text id="14000402"></text>
<text id="14000403">What are you doing?</text>
<text id="14000404">Cease this foolishness.</text>
<text id="14000500"></text>
<text id="14000501"></text>
<text id="14000502">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="14000503">Little bird, what's to be gained?</text>
<text id="14000600">Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14000601">I wish to express my gratitude.</text>
<text id="14000602">For trusting a lowly pyromancer, and allowing me to gaze upon this majestic flame.</text>
<text id="14000603">As promised, I will impart pyromancies to you.</text>
<text id="14000604">But first, you'll need a flame of your own.</text>
<text id="14000605">Careful you don't burn yourself with it.</text>
<text id="14000606"></text>
<text id="14000700">Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14000701">I am pleased to have a pupil as dedicated as you.</text>
<text id="14000702"></text>
<text id="14000800">Do not be gone for long.</text>
<text id="14000801">What is a teacher without a pupil?</text>
<text id="14000802"></text>
<text id="14000900">To learn pyromancies, you must vow to become my pupil.</text>
<text id="14000901">I know, I know, but such is the way of the world. Respect your elders, and so on.</text>
<text id="14000902">And pyromancy, of course, is no exception.</text>
<text id="14000903"></text>
<text id="14001000">Oh, we'll need a pyromancy tome to learn more advanced pyromancies.</text>
<text id="14001001">Though unorthodox, that would be the most expedient way to make progress.</text>
<text id="14001002">If this were the Great Swamp, and you had the luxury of time, we could have trained you the hard way.</text>
<text id="14001003"></text>
<text id="14001100">If you seek pyromancy tomes, take this sage advice.</text>
<text id="14001101">The lands of the Lords converge upon Lothric.</text>
<text id="14001102">The home of pyromancies drifts comparatively close, as well.</text>
<text id="14001103">At least, that is what pyromancers of the Great Swamp believe.</text>
<text id="14001104">The place is called Izalith. Oh, how I wish to behold a primal pyromancy.</text>
<text id="14001105">Well, these are old tales. No one knows where the truth begins, or ends.</text>
<text id="14001106"></text>
<text id="14001200">Ahh, you found this tome in the Catacombs...</text>
<text id="14001201">This spell is akin to chaos.</text>
<text id="14001202">It may even serve as a link to Izalith, home of pyromancies...</text>
<text id="14001300">Heed my words, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14001301">Fear the fire.</text>
<text id="14001302">The home of pyromancy, Izalith, was scorched by the very fire it created.</text>
<text id="14001303">Undoubtedly, it was a flame of chaos, tangled by a witch's hand.</text>
<text id="14001304">But who's to say that this Bonfire's flame is any different?</text>
<text id="14001400">Yes, here we are. It's been long indeed.</text>
<text id="14001401">With this, I can teach you more sophisticated pyromancies.</text>
<text id="14001402">Splendid. I can boast I am your tutor a little longer.</text>
<text id="14001403"></text>
<text id="14001500">Well, well...I've never seen anything like this.</text>
<text id="14001501">This inscription...this tome is from the Catacombs.</text>
<text id="14001502">Fascinating. On this day, the teacher learns alongside the pupil.</text>
<text id="14001503"></text>
<text id="14001600">Ah, what have we here! A pyromancy tome from Izalith!</text>
<text id="14001601">Then you've found the home of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="14001602">Brilliant. I will never curse being old and Undead again.</text>
<text id="14001603">Now, now, show it here, quickly. Let us channel them together.</text>
<text id="14001604">The primal pyromancies known only to old Master Salaman!</text>
<text id="14001700">Ahh, what have we here...</text>
<text id="14001701">By the gods. This inscription reads Quelana, the ancient deity, one of the witches of Izalith...</text>
<text id="14001702">The last of them, who wandered the lands. Then she must have returned to Izalith, after all.</text>
<text id="14001703">But I regret to say, I cannot accept this.</text>
<text id="14001704">Quelana's pyromancies are for witches, and must be learned from a mistress.</text>
<text id="14001705">But thank you, for allowing me to peer upon such a thing.</text>
<text id="14001706">If only I were a woman.</text>
<text id="14001707"></text>
<text id="14001800">I'm afraid I cannot accept this.</text>
<text id="14001801">This pyromancy tome is dark, and delves into the depths of men, where an untouchable flame resides.</text>
<text id="14001802">I cannot comprehend this myself, let alone teach it to you.</text>
<text id="14001803">It is a spell forbidden in the Great Swamp, and nearly everywhere else, too.</text>
<text id="14001804">Only one terribly afflicted, or burdened by deep sorrow, could begin to understand this.</text>
<text id="14001900"></text>
<text id="14001901"></text>
<text id="14001902"></text>
<text id="14001903">Why? What's the matter?</text>
<text id="14001904">Stop this, stop this at once!</text>
<text id="14002000">Fine, fine, I see how it is.</text>
<text id="14002001">When a pupil strays from the path, the master must intrude.</text>
<text id="14002002">Prepare yourself, hatchling.</text>
<text id="14002003">Behold, the pyromancy of an old crow!</text>
<text id="14002004"></text>
<text id="14002005"></text>
<text id="14002100"></text>
<text id="14002101"></text>
<text id="14002102">I can't complain... This old reverie...had to end...</text>
<text id="14002200">You've been dabbling in pyromancies, it seems?</text>
<text id="14002201">Well then, care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?</text>
<text id="14002300">Oh, the eternal folly of youth...</text>
<text id="14002400">Spare the rod and spoil the child...</text>
<text id="15000000">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="15000001">I thought you'd all but forgotten me. How sweet.</text>
<text id="15000002">Good to know that a skinny little heretic can still turn heads.</text>
<text id="15000003"></text>
<text id="15000100">Hm? Oh...you're not one of them, are you?</text>
<text id="15000101">Accept my apologies, for mistaking you for one of those leeches.</text>
<text id="15000102">So, what business have you here?</text>
<text id="15000103">This is a land of monstrosities. And I am no exception.</text>
<text id="15000200">Would I serve you?</text>
<text id="15000201">Then you must be involved in linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="15000202">Ahh, very well. I can do very little holed up here.</text>
<text id="15000203">I am Feria, of the Profaned Capital, and I hereby enter into your service.</text>
<text id="15000300"></text>
<text id="15000301">You are very frank.</text>
<text id="15000302">If you've no business here, take your leave at once.</text>
<text id="15000303">For your own sake.</text>
<text id="15000400">What is it? Something else?</text>
<text id="15000401">Ahh, don't fret over me. I'm stuck here anyway.</text>
<text id="15000500"></text>
<text id="15000501"></text>
<text id="15000502">Why, you're one of those leeches after all.</text>
<text id="15000503">How dare you feign humanity.</text>
<text id="15000504"></text>
<text id="15000600"></text>
<text id="15000601">Cursed leech, I await you, in the Abyss...</text>
<text id="15000602"></text>
<text id="15000700">Ahh, there you are.</text>
<text id="15000701">As I said, I am Karla. And am grateful to you.</text>
<text id="15000702">Now, what shall we do.</text>
<text id="15000703">The only thing that might interest you is my sorcery.</text>
<text id="15000704">Although my dark arts are a detestable sort.</text>
<text id="15000705">That wouldn't interest you, would it?</text>
<text id="15000800"></text>
<text id="15000801">You're a wicked one, aren't you?</text>
<text id="15000802">Very well. Humans are of the dark, and you are no different.</text>
<text id="15000803">Some may avert their eyes, but the truth remains the truth.</text>
<text id="15000804">Be careful though. Few humans are privy to this knowledge.</text>
<text id="15000805">Let it be a secret, between you and I...</text>
<text id="15000900"></text>
<text id="15000901">Most regrettable.</text>
<text id="15000902">I have nothing else, you see, nothing at all.</text>
<text id="15000903">Have you so soon forgotten? That place is home only to monstrous things, and I am no exception.</text>
<text id="15001000">Ahh, hello there. I'm sorry to say...</text>
<text id="15001001">This truly is all I have.</text>
<text id="15001002">Detestable sorceries that delve into the darkness of man...</text>
<text id="15001100">Ahh, hello again. Thank goodness.</text>
<text id="15001101">Yes, yes, you require my sorceries, I presume?</text>
<text id="15001102"></text>
<text id="15001200">Ahh, hello again. Thank goodness.</text>
<text id="15001201">One can become quite attached, even to a bumbling apprentice.</text>
<text id="15001202">Oh, I'm hardly serious.</text>
<text id="15001203"></text>
<text id="15001300">Do stay safe.</text>
<text id="15001400">Don't stir up any trouble.</text>
<text id="15001401">You're my apprentice, don't forget.</text>
<text id="15001402"></text>
<text id="15001500">There is one thing that you should know.</text>
<text id="15001501">There is a darkness within man, and I am afraid you will peer into it.</text>
<text id="15001502">Whether the fear will spark self-reflection, or a ruinous nostalgia...</text>
<text id="15001503">...is up to you entirely.</text>
<text id="15001504">Fear not, your choice will bring you no scorn.</text>
<text id="15001505">Ahh, it's little wonder my kindness is lost on most...</text>
<text id="15001506"></text>
<text id="15001600">Oh, a pyromancy tome, have we?</text>
<text id="15001601">Quelana, Witch of Izalith...well, this is a fascinating pyromancy...</text>
<text id="15001602">Very well. If this is your wish.</text>
<text id="15001603">I will unravel the thing the best I can.</text>
<text id="15001604">Besides. It will be nice to play master for once.</text>
<text id="15001605"></text>
<text id="15001700">Ohh, another pyromancy tome, have we?</text>
<text id="15001701">Quelana, Witch of Izalith...well, this is a fascinating pyromancy...</text>
<text id="15001702">I may be a heretical sorcerer, but you bring me nothing but pyromancies!</text>
<text id="15001703">Fiendish little lad, you...</text>
<text id="15001704">Fiendish little lass, you...</text>
<text id="15001705"></text>
<text id="15001800">Oh, a pyromancy tome, have we?</text>
<text id="15001801">And one that resonates with the dark, yes, well suited to me...</text>
<text id="15001802"></text>
<text id="15001803">Very well. If this is your wish.</text>
<text id="15001804">I will unravel the thing the best I can.</text>
<text id="15001805">Besides. It will be nice to play master for once.</text>
<text id="15001806"></text>
<text id="15001900">Oh, another pyromancy tome, have we?</text>
<text id="15001901">And one that resonates with the dark, yes, well suited to me...</text>
<text id="15001902"></text>
<text id="15001903">I may be a heretical sorcerer, but you bring me nothing but pyromancies!</text>
<text id="15001904">Fiendish little lad, you...</text>
<text id="15001905">Fiendish little lass, you...</text>
<text id="15001906"></text>
<text id="15002000">Oh, is this a Divine Tome?</text>
<text id="15002001">What on earth are you thinking?</text>
<text id="15002002">I wouldn't go near a Divine Tome or any so-called miracle.</text>
<text id="15002003">And casters of miracles are sure to steer clear of me.</text>
<text id="15002004">So, please.</text>
<text id="15002005">Don't torture me so.</text>
<text id="15002100">Ahh, you, how could you...</text>
<text id="15002101">Ahhh....</text>
<text id="15002102">I know, I know. I owe my life to you.</text>
<text id="15002103">Fine, then. Just this once, I will tell you this tale.</text>
<text id="15002104">But do understand, it will be my first time.</text>
<text id="15002105">I'll have no sniggering, should I err.</text>
<text id="15002200"></text>
<text id="15002201"></text>
<text id="15002202">What's wrong?</text>
<text id="15002203">How could you?</text>
<text id="15002204"></text>
<text id="15002300"></text>
<text id="15002301">You're a fickle one...</text>
<text id="15002302">And vicious...</text>
<text id="15002303"></text>
<text id="15002400">You're here to save me...?</text>
<text id="15002401">But I am guilty. A wretched child of the Abyss.</text>
<text id="15002402">Is that something you can forgive?</text>
<text id="15002500">Oh, really. You are no ordinary man.</text>
<text id="15002501">Oh, really. You are no ordinary woman.</text>
<text id="15002502">Very well. Besides, I've grown tired of imprisonment.</text>
<text id="15002503">I am Karla, and I accept your proposal.</text>
<text id="15002600">Oh, are you lost on your journey?</text>
<text id="15002601">No matter, today's lost are conquerors tomorrow.</text>
<text id="15002602">It only demonstrates the makings of a champion.</text>
<text id="15002603">And besides, whatever your choice...</text>
<text id="15002604">It will not change my sense of gratitude, or how I think of you.</text>
<text id="16000000">Ahh, who's there?</text>
<text id="16000001">Is someone there, anyone?</text>
<text id="16000002">Ahh, please, whoever you are, touch me.</text>
<text id="16000003">The dark surrounds me, nibbles at my flesh.</text>
<text id="16000004">Little creatures, they never stop biting.</text>
<text id="16000005">So please, hold out your hand, and touch me...</text>
<text id="16000100">Ahh, yes, there you are, so close, indeed.</text>
<text id="16000101">Then I am not entirely alone, just yet.</text>
<text id="16000102">Praise the merciful gods above...</text>
<text id="16000200">Oh, forgive me.</text>
<text id="16000201">I am Irina of Carim.</text>
<text id="16000202">I came to this land so that I might be a Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="16000203">Your touch has freed me from the darkness. You are a Champion, then?</text>
<text id="16000204">I am weak, and unfit to tend the flames,</text>
<text id="16000205">But if it would not trouble you, might I enter into your service, instead?</text>
<text id="16000300">Oh, thank you, sweet Champion.</text>
<text id="16000301">I shall take my vows.</text>
<text id="16000302">I, Irina of Carim, solemnly swear to serve you.</text>
<text id="16000400">Ahh, yes, of course, I understand.</text>
<text id="16000401">Even so, I thank you deeply. For your touch.</text>
<text id="16000402">I will never forget it, not ever.</text>
<text id="16000500">Oh, sweet Champion. You still wish to converse?</text>
<text id="16000501">Don't worry about me. I've long dealt in dark. It is my calling.</text>
<text id="16000502"></text>
<text id="16000600"></text>
<text id="16000601"></text>
<text id="16000602"></text>
<text id="16000603">Have mercy!</text>
<text id="16000604">Please, stop this!</text>
<text id="16000700"></text>
<text id="16000701"></text>
<text id="16000702">Ohh, great gods, forgive me...</text>
<text id="16000800">Oh, Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="16000801">You truly are all the tales said you would be.</text>
<text id="16000802">I was not meant to be a Fire Keeper, but I am honoured to serve you beside the Bonfire.</text>
<text id="16000803">The gods are ever-merciful. My gratitude lies with them, and with you.</text>
<text id="16000804">I am yours now. Your wish is my command.</text>
<text id="16000900">Oh, Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="16000901">Do you wish to hear a tale? You only have to ask.</text>
<text id="16001000">Have a pleasant journey, Champion of Ash.</text>
<text id="16001001">I pray for your safety.</text>
<text id="16001100">You know, in my home of Carim, I was a nun.</text>
<text id="16001101">I would be pleased to share the tales of miracles with you.</text>
<text id="16001102">Although to be honest, I only know a few.</text>
<text id="16001103">But if I had a divine tome, I could tell you many tales and more.</text>
<text id="16001104">Ahh, only I cannot see...</text>
<text id="16001105">Terribly sorry, but you'll have to find me a Divine Tome in braille.</text>
<text id="16001200">Ahh, you've brought me a braille Divine Tome.</text>
<text id="16001201">Now I can tell new tales of miracles.</text>
<text id="16001202">Tales of the greater miracles can be quite the epics...</text>
<text id="16001203">What fun we will have.</text>
<text id="16001204"></text>
<text id="16001300">Ahh, you've brought me a braille Divine Tome.</text>
<text id="16001301">Now I can tell you new tales of miracles.</text>
<text id="16001302">Tales of the old dragon hunters.</text>
<text id="16001303">Perhaps the kind you might enjoy...</text>
<text id="16001400">Oh, what's this...</text>
<text id="16001401">Champion of Ash, this Divine Tome is forbidden...</text>
<text id="16001402">These are dark tales of things that lurk deep within men... These stories would not please you...</text>
<text id="16001403">Of course, if you insist, I will read them for you.</text>
<text id="16001404">Only, ahh, ahh, they frighten me so.</text>
<text id="16001405">The little creatures that nibble at me in the darkness...</text>
<text id="16001500">Ahh, ahh, sweet Champion. Where have you been?</text>
<text id="16001501">Please, your touch...</text>
<text id="16001502">The little creatures, how they nip and bite...</text>
<text id="16001600">Ahh, sweet Champion. Leaving so soon?</text>
<text id="16001601">Please, come back in good time.</text>
<text id="16001602">I am frightened. Of the dark that gnaws away at me.</text>
<text id="16001700">Ahh, you've brought me a braille Divine Tome.</text>
<text id="16001701">Now I can tell you tales of miracles, forever and ever...</text>
<text id="16001702"></text>
<text id="16001800">Ahh, ahh, someone, please, touch me.</text>
<text id="16001801">The dark, surrounds me, nibbles at my flesh.</text>
<text id="16001802">Little creatures, they never stop biting.</text>
<text id="16001803">So please, hold out your hand, and touch me...</text>
<text id="16001900"></text>
<text id="16001901"></text>
<text id="16001902"></text>
<text id="16001903">Have mercy, please!</text>
<text id="16001904">Please, stop this, sweet Champion!</text>
<text id="16002000"></text>
<text id="16002001"></text>
<text id="16002002">What have you done, sweet Champion of Ash...</text>
<text id="16002003">I only wanted to...</text>
<text id="16002100">Thank you ever so much, sweet Champion.</text>
<text id="16002101">May your solemn duty conclude in triumph.</text>
<text id="16002200">Godspeed, Champion of Ash.</text>
<text id="16002201">May your solemn duty conclude in triumph.</text>
<text id="16002300">Ohh, is there no one near to touch me?</text>
<text id="16002301">Keep these things from eating away at me.</text>
<text id="16002302">(sobs - several versions)</text>
<text id="16002400">Ohh, you again, touch me, one last time.</text>
<text id="16002401">And kill me, as you promised you would.</text>
<text id="16002402">(giggle)</text>
<text id="16002403">(giggle - longer)</text>
<text id="16002500">Ohh, sweet Champion of Ash.</text>
<text id="16002501">Let souls be your strength...</text>
<text id="16002600"></text>
<text id="16002601"></text>
<text id="16002602">Ahh, thank you ever so much.</text>
<text id="16002603">For your touch...</text>
<text id="16002700"></text>
<text id="16002701"></text>
<text id="16002702">Ohh, a knight of Carim...</text>
<text id="16002703">...is always true to his word...</text>
<text id="16002704"></text>
<text id="17000000">Hmm... Another one of those Unkindled, are you?</text>
<text id="17000001">All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.</text>
<text id="17000002">Hmph. No matter. Heed my words.</text>
<text id="17000003">If you've any sense, you'll go find a coffin to huddle up inside.</text>
<text id="17000004">You here, in this land of Hollows, you're like a frail maiden on the front lines.</text>
<text id="17000005">If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion...</text>
<text id="17000006">Then go on ahead, traipse right past the abandoned church.</text>
<text id="17000007">You'll face death, and it won't be pretty.</text>
<text id="17000008">Enough death to leave you broken, time after time.</text>
<text id="17000009"></text>
<text id="17000100">If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion...</text>
<text id="17000101">Then go on ahead, traipse right past the abandoned church.</text>
<text id="17000102">Hopeless, the whole lot of you. Like little moths, flittering toward a flame.</text>
<text id="17000103"></text>
<text id="17000200">You like poking around in cells, do you?</text>
<text id="17000201">How very genteel!</text>
<text id="17000202"></text>
<text id="17000300">Ah-hah, taken an interest in her, have you?</text>
<text id="17000301">Well, she's a lost cause. Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="17000302">After I brought her all this way, and got her all ready.</text>
<text id="17000303">She's beyond repair, I tell you.</text>
<text id="17000304"></text>
<text id="17000400">The woman's a lost cause.</text>
<text id="17000401">Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="17000402">She's beyond repair, I tell you.</text>
<text id="17000403"></text>
<text id="17000500">Hmm... Another one of those Unkindled, are you?</text>
<text id="17000501">All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.</text>
<text id="17000502">Now you're poking around in peoples' cells.</text>
<text id="17000503">How very noble!</text>
<text id="17000504"></text>
<text id="17000600">You've gone and rescued her, have you?</text>
<text id="17000601">How very quaint, pitying creatures that are beyond help.</text>
<text id="17000602"></text>
<text id="17000603">Very well. I'm sick of looking after her at any rate.</text>
<text id="17000604">I am Eygon, a knight of Carim.</text>
<text id="17000605">I am allied to you as long as you assure the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17000606">And only for that long...</text>
<text id="17000700">What's the matter? My terms are very simple.</text>
<text id="17000701">I am allied to you for as long as you assure the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17000702">And only for that long...</text>
<text id="17000703"></text>
<text id="17000800">Hmm... Another one of those Unkindled, are you?</text>
<text id="17000801">All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.</text>
<text id="17000802">Now you've gone and rescued the wench...</text>
<text id="17000803">How very quaint, pitying creatures that are beyond help.</text>
<text id="17000804"></text>
<text id="17000805">Hmph, very well. I'm sick of looking after her at any rate.</text>
<text id="17000806">I am Eygon, a knight of Carim.</text>
<text id="17000807">I am allied to you for as long as you assure the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17000808">And only for that long...</text>
<text id="17000900">Ahh, I know you. Been some time, since we met in person.</text>
<text id="17000901">Ahh, I know you. Been some time.</text>
<text id="17000902">I just dropped in to see how she's getting on.</text>
<text id="17000903">Now, what are you playing at with this circus?</text>
<text id="17000904">This cesspool of doddering oldfolk and degenerates.</text>
<text id="17000905">Couldn't be better. She must fit in perfectly here.</text>
<text id="17000906"></text>
<text id="17001000">This place is a cesspool of doddering oldfolk and degenerates.</text>
<text id="17001001">Couldn't hope for better. She must fit in perfectly here.</text>
<text id="17001002"></text>
<text id="17001100">I made myself very clear.</text>
<text id="17001101">My allegiance remained only as long as you assured the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17001102">This knight of Carim does not forgive betrayal.</text>
<text id="17001103">Even a broken woman deserves her dignity... </text>
<text id="17001200"></text>
<text id="17001201"></text>
<text id="17001202"></text>
<text id="17001203">What is it now!</text>
<text id="17001204">Curse you, damn fool!</text>
<text id="17001300">Lost it, have you?</text>
<text id="17001301">Then I'll take care of you.</text>
<text id="17001302">As many times as it takes!</text>
<text id="17001303"></text>
<text id="17001400">Stay dead this time.</text>
<text id="17001500"></text>
<text id="17001501"></text>
<text id="17001502">Deluded Hollow bastard...</text>
<text id="17001503"></text>
<text id="17001600">Remember. A knight of Carim does not forgive betrayal.</text>
<text id="17001601">Not ever.</text>
<text id="17001700"></text>
<text id="17001701"></text>
<text id="17001702">You monster. Just how many souls have you eaten?</text>
<text id="17001703"></text>
<text id="17001704"></text>
<text id="19000000">Oh, hello. How do you do.</text>
<text id="19000001">I am Anri of Astora. Unkindled, like you.</text>
<text id="19000002">This is Horace. A friend and travelling companion.</text>
<text id="19000003">Are you too in search of the Lords of Cinder?</text>
<text id="19000004">We are well along the road of sacrifices. Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.</text>
<text id="19000005">Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion. Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="19000006">We seek the cathedral, home of the grim Aldrich.</text>
<text id="19000007">We may go our separate ways now, but we are both seekers of lords.</text>
<text id="19000008">The next time we cross paths, one may find the other in a time of need.</text>
<text id="19000009">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19000100">Oh, yes, Horace...</text>
<text id="19000101">He's not very talkative.</text>
<text id="19000102">But don't think ill of him. He's an upstanding, kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey.</text>
<text id="19000103">Without his help, I would have cursed this onerous duty long ago.</text>
<text id="19000200">We are well along the road of sacrifices. Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.</text>
<text id="19000201">Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion. Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="19000202">We may go our separate ways now, but we are both seekers of lords.</text>
<text id="19000203">The next time we cross paths, one may find the other in a time of need.</text>
<text id="19000204">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19000300">Oh, and we meet again.</text>
<text id="19000301">We spoke before on the road of sacrifices. Anri of Astora.</text>
<text id="19000302">I am well pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="19000303">We reached the Cathedral of the Deep, but Aldrich's coffin was empty.</text>
<text id="19000304">The man-eater must have left for his true home.</text>
<text id="19000305">The little doll in the empty coffin told me.</text>
<text id="19000306">Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, an ancient fabled city...</text>
<text id="19000307">A pilgrim told me that the city lies beyond Farron Keep.</text>
<text id="19000308">And so becomes our destination...</text>
<text id="19000400">Aldrich's honest home is Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, an ancient fabled city...</text>
<text id="19000401">A pilgrim told me that the city lies beyond Farron Keep.</text>
<text id="19000402">And so becomes our destination...</text>
<text id="19000500">Oh, hello, how very fortunate.</text>
<text id="19000501">Have you seen my companion, Horace?</text>
<text id="19000502">To my shame, I was snared by a trap, and we've become separated.</text>
<text id="19000503">I've not been able to find him since.</text>
<text id="19000600">Yes, I see.</text>
<text id="19000601">Horace is a valiant knight. He can look after himself, no question.</text>
<text id="19000602">He's probably searching for me right now, with twice the resolve.</text>
<text id="19000603">If you happen upon him, please tell him.</text>
<text id="19000604">That I remain in the catacombs...</text>
<text id="19000605">And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always.</text>
<text id="19000606">Please send him my word, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="19000607">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19000700">If you happen upon Horace, please tell him.</text>
<text id="19000701">That I remain in the catacombs...</text>
<text id="19000702">And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always.</text>
<text id="19000703">Please send him my word, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="19000704">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19000800">Ah, hello, we meet again.</text>
<text id="19000801">Have you seen Horace anywhere?</text>
<text id="19000900">Goodness me.</text>
<text id="19000901">To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs.</text>
<text id="19000902">What a relief. I knew that Horace was alive, and wouldn't stray far.</text>
<text id="19000903">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>
<text id="19000904">This hardly expresses my gratitude, but it'll have to do for now.</text>
<text id="19000905">Please, take it. And may the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19001000">I will soon head to the lake.</text>
<text id="19001001">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>
<text id="19001002">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19001100">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="19001101">I've searched high and low, with no luck. Perhaps he's left the catacombs.</text>
<text id="19001102">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text id="19001200">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text id="19001201">Have you abandoned me? No, what a horrible thought...</text>
<text id="19001300">Oh, I thought it might be you. Good to see you.</text>
<text id="19001301">I never managed to find Horace.</text>
<text id="19001302">But my duty must be done, even alone. As an unkindled Lordseeker.</text>
<text id="19001303">For the children I knew, bless their souls.</text>
<text id="19001304">We all have our reasons, don't we?</text>
<text id="19001305">Please, take this. Recompense for my foolish request.</text>
<text id="19001306">And also a token of protection. May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19001400">Ahh, you are brave indeed. To face your duty alone.</text>
<text id="19001401">I would do well to learn from you.</text>
<text id="19001402">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19001500"></text>
<text id="19001501"></text>
<text id="19001502"></text>
<text id="19001503">What's happened to you?</text>
<text id="19001504">Please, stop this!</text>
<text id="19001600">You've gone Hollow, have you?</text>
<text id="19001601">Then I shall put you to rest.</text>
<text id="19001602">Horace! Join me!</text>
<text id="19001603">And may the flames watch over us!</text>
<text id="19001604"></text>
<text id="19001700">Oh, Horace, why...</text>
<text id="19001701">Don't leave me, not you...</text>
<text id="19001702">Not like the others...</text>
<text id="19001703">Oh, Horace, Horace...</text>
<text id="19001800"></text>
<text id="19001801"></text>
<text id="19001802">Forgive me, Horace...</text>
<text id="19001803">It pains me...to leave you...</text>
<text id="19001900"></text>
<text id="19001901"></text>
<text id="19001902">Oh, Horace, everyone, forgive me...</text>
<text id="19001903">I was weak on my own...</text>
<text id="19002000">Ahh, I thought it might be you.</text>
<text id="19002001">Then I'm afraid Horace...</text>
<text id="19002002">...No, this only bolsters my resolve.</text>
<text id="19002003">Please. Lend me your strength.</text>
<text id="19002004">Help me vanquish Aldrich, the man-eating fiend.</text>
<text id="19002100">Yes...we did it...</text>
<text id="19002101">I owe this to you. Thank you. Truly.</text>
<text id="19002102">Horace, we've done it, we really have...</text>
<text id="19010000">Oh, hello. How do you do.</text>
<text id="19010001">I'm Anri of Astora. Unkindled, like you.</text>
<text id="19010002">This is Horace. A friend and travelling companion.</text>
<text id="19010003">Are you too in search of the Lords of Cinder?</text>
<text id="19010004">We are well along the road of sacrifices. Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.</text>
<text id="19010005">Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion. Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="19010006">We seek the cathedral, home of the grim Aldrich.</text>
<text id="19010007">We may go our separate ways now, but we are both seekers of lords.</text>
<text id="19010008">The next time we cross paths, one may find the other in a time of need.</text>
<text id="19010009">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19010100">Oh, yes, Horace...</text>
<text id="19010101">He's not very talkative.</text>
<text id="19010102">But don't think ill of him. He is an upstanding, kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey.</text>
<text id="19010103">Without his help, I would have cursed this onerous duty long ago.</text>
<text id="19010200">We are well along the road of sacrifices. Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.</text>
<text id="19010201">Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep, home of the Undead Legion. Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="19010202">We may go our separate ways now, but we are both seekers of lords.</text>
<text id="19010203">The next time we cross paths, one may find the other in a time of need.</text>
<text id="19010204">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19010300">Oh, and we meet again.</text>
<text id="19010301">We spoke before on the road of sacrifices. Anri of Astora.</text>
<text id="19010302">I am well pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="19010303">We reached the Cathedral of the Deep, but Aldrich's coffin was empty.</text>
<text id="19010304">The man-eater must have left for his true home.</text>
<text id="19010305">The little doll in the empty coffin told me.</text>
<text id="19010306">Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, an ancient fabled city...</text>
<text id="19010307">A pilgrim told me that the city lies beyond Farron Keep.</text>
<text id="19010308">And so becomes our destination...</text>
<text id="19010400">Aldrich's honest home is Irithyll in the Boreal Valley, an ancient fabled city...</text>
<text id="19010401">A pilgrim told me that the city lies beyond Farron Keep.</text>
<text id="19010402">And so becomes our destination...</text>
<text id="19010500">Oh, hello, how very fortunate.</text>
<text id="19010501">Have you seen my companion, Horace?</text>
<text id="19010502">To my shame, I was snared by a trap, and we've become separated.</text>
<text id="19010503">I've not been able to find him since.</text>
<text id="19010600">Yes, I see.</text>
<text id="19010601">Horace is a valiant knight. He can look after himself, no question.</text>
<text id="19010602">He's probably searching for me right now, with twice the resolve.</text>
<text id="19010603">If you happen upon him, please tell him.</text>
<text id="19010604">That I remain in the catacombs...</text>
<text id="19010605">And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always.</text>
<text id="19010606">Please send him word, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="19010607">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19010700">If you happen upon Horace, please tell him.</text>
<text id="19010701">That I remain in the catacombs...</text>
<text id="19010702">And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always.</text>
<text id="19010703">Please send him word, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="19010704">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19010800">Ah, hello, we meet again.</text>
<text id="19010801">Have you seen Horace anywhere?</text>
<text id="19010900">Goodness me.</text>
<text id="19010901">To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs.</text>
<text id="19010902">What a relief. I knew that Horace was alive, and wouldn't stray far.</text>
<text id="19010903">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>
<text id="19010904">This hardly expresses my gratitude, but it'll have to do for now.</text>
<text id="19010905">Please, take it. And may the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19011000">I will soon head to the lake.</text>
<text id="19011001">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>
<text id="19011002">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19011100">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="19011101">I've searched high and low, with no luck. Perhaps he's left the catacombs.</text>
<text id="19011102">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text id="19011200">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text id="19011201">Have you abandoned me? No, what a horrible thought...</text>
<text id="19011300">Oh, I thought it might be you. Good to see you.</text>
<text id="19011301">I never managed to find Horace.</text>
<text id="19011302">But my duty must be done, even alone. As an unkindled Lordseeker.</text>
<text id="19011303">For the children I knew, bless their souls.</text>
<text id="19011304">We all have our reasons, don't we?</text>
<text id="19011305">Please, take this. Recompense for my foolish request.</text>
<text id="19011306">And also a token of protection. May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19011400">Ahh, you are brave indeed. To face your duty alone.</text>
<text id="19011401">I would do well to learn from you.</text>
<text id="19011402">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text id="19011500"></text>
<text id="19011501"></text>
<text id="19011502"></text>
<text id="19011503">What's happened to you?</text>
<text id="19011504">Please, stop this!</text>
<text id="19011600">You've gone Hollow, have you?</text>
<text id="19011601">Then I shall put you to rest.</text>
<text id="19011602">Horace! Join me!</text>
<text id="19011603">And may the flames watch over us!</text>
<text id="19011604">(Attack sounds - several versions. He/she wields a long sword)</text>
<text id="19011700">Oh, Horace, why...</text>
<text id="19011701">Don't leave me, not you...</text>
<text id="19011702">Not like the others...</text>
<text id="19011703">Oh, Horace, Horace...</text>
<text id="19011800"></text>
<text id="19011801"></text>
<text id="19011802">Forgive me, Horace...</text>
<text id="19011803">It pains me...to leave you...</text>
<text id="19011900"></text>
<text id="19011901"></text>
<text id="19011902">Oh, Horace, everyone, forgive me...</text>
<text id="19011903">I was weak on my own...</text>
<text id="19012000">Mmm, I thought it might be you.</text>
<text id="19012001">Then I'm afraid Horace...</text>
<text id="19012002">...No, this only bolsters my resolve.</text>
<text id="19012003">Please. Lend me your strength.</text>
<text id="19012004">Help me vanquish Aldrich, the man-eating fiend.</text>
<text id="19012100">Yes...we did it...</text>
<text id="19012101">I owe this to you. Thank you. Truly.</text>
<text id="19012102">Horace, we've done it, we really have...</text>
<text id="20000000">Well, you look reasonably sane.</text>
<text id="20000001">I am a knight of Catarina.</text>
<text id="20000002">I've managed to track down this cathedral's store of treasure.</text>
<text id="20000003">It's right over there, across that narrow part.</text>
<text id="20000004">Treasure...hmm. Always so close, yet so far...</text>
<text id="20000005">I'm in quite a pickle, indeed...</text>
<text id="20000006">Hmm... Hmm...</text>
<text id="20000100">Just hold your horses a moment.</text>
<text id="20000101">I know, I know, treasure is so sorely tempting...</text>
<text id="20000102">Hmm... Hmm...</text>
<text id="20000200">Shame on you, you greedy guts. </text>
<text id="20000201">Shame on you, you insatiable wench.</text>
<text id="20000202">Shame on you, you rotten cleric.</text>
<text id="20000203">Shame on you, you rotten nun.</text>
<text id="20000204">Thought you could outwit an onion?</text>
<text id="20000205">Well, say hello to the nice giant! He adores visitors.</text>
<text id="20000206"></text>
<text id="20000207"></text>
<text id="20000300">Huh? Where's the old giant?</text>
<text id="20000301">What! Where's the bloody giant!</text>
<text id="20000302">Just what have you done?!</text>
<text id="20000303">How dare you! Have you no shame!</text>
<text id="20000304">Damn! Damn! Damn!</text>
<text id="20000400">Oh, yes, oh, hello, I don't believe we've met.</text>
<text id="20000401">I'm Patches. Unbreakable Patches.</text>
<text id="20000402">You seem to be Unkindled.</text>
<text id="20000403">Do you have business with me?</text>
<text id="20000500">Ah, oh, yes, of course...It's coming back to me, now.</text>
<text id="20000501">Oh, I am so sorry. That was my hand, as you know, but the deed, well, that was the armour's doing.</text>
<text id="20000502">Regrettable, truly. But behold, I'm stripped clean of that unruly attire.</text>
<text id="20000503">And look at you, not a scratch!</text>
<text id="20000504">All's well that ends well, right?</text>
<text id="20000505">Yes, we'll be fine, I can tell, it's that rotten curse, it is, the untidy mess.</text>
<text id="20000506"></text>
<text id="20000600">Oh, ahh, yes, now, it wasn't me, but you still deserve an apology.</text>
<text id="20000601">Just a little trinket. Go ahead, it's yours now.</text>
<text id="20000602"></text>
<text id="20000603">You should know, I'm a kind of traveling merchant.</text>
<text id="20000604">If you're as Unkindled as you look, you'll find plenty of good stuff.</text>
<text id="20000700">Oh, yes, yes, what can I do?</text>
<text id="20000701">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20000800">Oh, hello again. Welcome to Patches' boutique of wonders.</text>
<text id="20000801">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20000900">Thanks, good compeer.</text>
<text id="20000901">Thanks, sweeting.</text>
<text id="20001000">Can't find anything you like?</text>
<text id="20001001">Well, you could try looking a little harder...</text>
<text id="20001100">Of course not, we have just met, after all.</text>
<text id="20001101">Sorry, I've been a bit on edge. Forget I even asked.</text>
<text id="20001102"></text>
<text id="20001103">Ahh, but this is your lucky day.</text>
<text id="20001104">I happen to be a world-renowned travelling merchant.</text>
<text id="20001105">If you're as Unkindled as you look, you'll find many a useful thing here.</text>
<text id="20001200">Sorry, friend.</text>
<text id="20001201">Be more careful! By the gods, curiosity is going to kill you kittens.</text>
<text id="20001202">Some places are better left alone, you know.</text>
<text id="20001203">Oh, sorry, am I a tad too late?</text>
<text id="20001204"></text>
<text id="20001300">Have no fear, there's beauty in death.</text>
<text id="20001301">Besides, you're surrounded by ladies. Every man's dream, right?</text>
<text id="20001302">Besides, you're amongst your own. Plenty of company, right?</text>
<text id="20001303">Besides, you're surrounded by ladies. Every rotten cleric's dream, right?</text>
<text id="20001304"></text>
<text id="20001400">Oh, no matter, I'll look after things.</text>
<text id="20001401">By stripping every last trinket off your corpse.</text>
<text id="20001402">You're going to make some lucky customer very happy!</text>
<text id="20001403"></text>
<text id="20001500">Ah, oh, you, you're alive...</text>
<text id="20001501">Now, hold your horses, let's have a nice talk about this.</text>
<text id="20001502">I'll come clean, I did you wrong. I didn't mean it, though, not one bit.</text>
<text id="20001503">You get these...urges...running the business and all...Oh, and I hate myself for it, I do.</text>
<text id="20001504">You know what I mean? Terrible, really. But I can see you'll forgive me.</text>
<text id="20001505">You're alive, after all, and that's what counts, right?</text>
<text id="20001600">Oh, fantastic! A wily second chance!</text>
<text id="20001601">I knew you'd understand, I just knew it.</text>
<text id="20001602">The heart of a lion. A model for the rest of us. A true friend, forever.</text>
<text id="20001603"></text>
<text id="20001700">Oh, for heaven's sake, no need to jest with a face like that.</text>
<text id="20001701">You're still alive, and I'm here grovelling in the dirt, so to speak.</text>
<text id="20001702">Oh, I know! Here, a token of my sincerity. Right and proper, eh?</text>
<text id="20001703">We're just a couple of outcasts, let's make the best of it!</text>
<text id="20001704"></text>
<text id="20001800">Oh, yes yes, what can I do?</text>
<text id="20001801">Aren't you glad we made good of things?</text>
<text id="20001900">Oh, hello again. Welcome to Patches' boutique of wonders.</text>
<text id="20001901">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20002000">Thanks, good compeer.</text>
<text id="20002001">Thanks, sweeting.</text>
<text id="20002100">Can't find anything you like?</text>
<text id="20002101">Well, you could try looking a little harder...</text>
<text id="20002200">Well, look at you. The luckiest man in the world.</text>
<text id="20002201">Well, look at you. The luckiest lass in the world.</text>
<text id="20002202">I just got hold of some truly fine treasure. And for you, I'll practically give it away.</text>
<text id="20002203"></text>
<text id="20002300">What do you say? Brilliant stuff, eh?</text>
<text id="20002301">I won't ask for thanks, but I certainly deserve it.</text>
<text id="20002302"></text>
<text id="20002400">Now, just wait, that's the best you can do? Bloody hell.</text>
<text id="20002401">Yeah, keep those purse strings nice and tight. So tight they choke you.</text>
<text id="20002500">Ahh, I see you've met Greirat.</text>
<text id="20002501">The slinking rodent. But he did me a good turn back in Lothric dungeon.</text>
<text id="20002502">Doubtless I should do something about that little debt, or...maybe not.</text>
<text id="20002503">Well, I can hardly believe he's still standing.</text>
<text id="20002504"></text>
<text id="20002600">Hey, what happened to Greirat, anyhow?</text>
<text id="20002601">I haven't seen him at all lately.</text>
<text id="20002602">If you know where he's scurried off to, be sure and tell me.</text>
<text id="20002603">I need to stock up, and if he's gone and croaked, he'll have left a gold mine.</text>
<text id="20002604"></text>
<text id="20002700">What? Gone all the way to Irithyll, has he?</text>
<text id="20002701">Well, there can't be much left of that frozen sprawl.</text>
<text id="20002702">The old rat, he's gone off the deep end this time...</text>
<text id="20002800">The old rat, he's gone off the deep end this time...</text>
<text id="20002900">Hmph. Off to Lothric, the castle of no return...</text>
<text id="20002901">That old thief's lost it if he thinks he has a chance in there.</text>
<text id="20002902">It's not like he's new to this game, what's gotten into him?</text>
<text id="20003000">That old thief, he's really lost it this time...</text>
<text id="20003100">Right, yes, I see how it is.</text>
<text id="20003101">Some things can't be divulged. Even between friends.</text>
<text id="20003102">It comes with the territory, I know.</text>
<text id="20003103">But if you happen to recall any details, do be a saint.</text>
<text id="20003104">Do it for old Patch's boutique of wonders, at least.</text>
<text id="20003105"></text>
<text id="20003200">Well? Happen to recall anything important?</text>
<text id="20003201">About where that old rat scurried off to.</text>
<text id="20003202"></text>
<text id="20003300"></text>
<text id="20003301"></text>
<text id="20003302"></text>
<text id="20003303">Oi, calm down, please!</text>
<text id="20003304">Forgive me! I'm on my hands and knees!</text>
<text id="20003305">All's well that ends well, right!</text>
<text id="20003306">Oh come on, you know it's true!</text>
<text id="20003400">Damn, you heartless, good-for-nothing oaf!</text>
<text id="20003401">Damn, you heartless little harlot! </text>
<text id="20003402">Well, now it's my turn.</text>
<text id="20003403">I'm Unbreakable Patches, nobody can crack me!</text>
<text id="20003404">Rot in hell!</text>
<text id="20003405"></text>
<text id="20003500"></text>
<text id="20003501"></text>
<text id="20003502">Gods' piss, just my bloody luck...</text>
<text id="20003503">What did I ever do, anyway?</text>
<text id="20003600">Cough 'em up, every last one of 'em.</text>
<text id="20003601">Confess your sins.</text>
<text id="20003700"></text>
<text id="20003701"></text>
<text id="20003702"></text>
<text id="20003703">What's happened, friend?</text>
<text id="20003704">Stop this! Stop this at once!</text>
<text id="20003800">Gods' spit, I knew something was wrong!</text>
<text id="20003801">Well, now it's my turn.</text>
<text id="20003802">I'm Unbreakable Patches, nobody can crack me!</text>
<text id="20003803">Rot in hell!</text>
<text id="20003804"></text>
<text id="20003900"></text>
<text id="20003901"></text>
<text id="20003902">Gods' spit and piss and blood...</text>
<text id="20003903">Why me? Why me?!</text>
<text id="20004000">Close call, blimey...</text>
<text id="21000100">Hmm...</text>
<text id="21000101">Mmmmmm...</text>
<text id="21000200">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000201">Oh!</text>
<text id="21000202">Pardon me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="21000203">I am Siegward of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21000204">To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle.</text>
<text id="21000205">Have you ever walked near a white birch, only to be struck by a great arrow?</text>
<text id="21000206">Well, if I'm not mistaken, they come from this tower.</text>
<text id="21000207">Whoever it is, I'm sure I can talk some sense into them.</text>
<text id="21000208">But I have to find a way up, and that's just the trouble.</text>
<text id="21000209">This lift only goes down, you see, and...</text>
<text id="21000210">Well, that doesn't get me anywhere... </text>
<text id="21000211">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000300">This lift only goes down, but you know...</text>
<text id="21000301">With a little warming up, eventually... No, no...</text>
<text id="21000302">I've got to use my head. And think.</text>
<text id="21000303">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000400">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000401">Ah, oh!</text>
<text id="21000402">Don't disappear like that. You had me downright worried.</text>
<text id="21000403">But thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me square in the head.</text>
<text id="21000404">I've unravelled the riddle of this inscrutable lift! </text>
<text id="21000405"></text>
<text id="21000500">On some days, I begin to doubt myself.</text>
<text id="21000501">I went up the tower, so I thought, then somehow ended up here.</text>
<text id="21000502">I'm not exactly sure what happened.</text>
<text id="21000503">Anyhow, do you see that? That humungous beast.</text>
<text id="21000504">I'm no coward, and I've a steady hand, but that thing makes my skin crawl.</text>
<text id="21000505">Now, now, think twice before you go down that road.</text>
<text id="21000600">I could try talking some sense into him...</text>
<text id="21000601">No, I think not. He's far too over-heated.</text>
<text id="21000602">I've got to use my head. And think.</text>
<text id="21000603">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000700">No! You should have waited!</text>
<text id="21000701">Well, it's too late now.</text>
<text id="21000702">I, Siegward of the Knights of Catarina, fight by your side!</text>
<text id="21000703"></text>
<text id="21000800"></text>
<text id="21000801">That was quite the performance.</text>
<text id="21000802">But you mustn't get in over your head.</text>
<text id="21000803">We Unkindled must put our duties first.</text>
<text id="21000804">But for the moment, we've a toast to make.</text>
<text id="21000805">To your valour, my sword, and our victory together.</text>
<text id="21000806">Long may the sun shine!</text>
<text id="21000807"></text>
<text id="21000900">Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap.</text>
<text id="21000901">The only thing to do, really, after a nice toast.</text>
<text id="21000902"></text>
<text id="21001000"></text>
<text id="21001001"></text>
<text id="21001002"></text>
<text id="21001100">Hello! Hello!</text>
<text id="21001101">Anyone there? Anyone at all?</text>
<text id="21001200">Oh!</text>
<text id="21001201">I know that voice. Just how long has it been!</text>
<text id="21001202">It's me, Siegward of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21001203">I'm loathe to admit it, but I've been had.</text>
<text id="21001204">Someone's swiped my armour.</text>
<text id="21001205">Did you happen to see it anywhere?</text>
<text id="21001300">Ah, oh! My armour!</text>
<text id="21001301">My deepest gratitude! I, Siegward of Catarina, salute you.</text>
<text id="21001302">With my trusty suit of armour, I'll be out of here in a jiffy.</text>
<text id="21001303">Until we meet again, comrade!</text>
<text id="21001304"></text>
<text id="21001400">No need to worry about me.</text>
<text id="21001401">With my trusty suit of armour, I'll be out of here in a jiffy.</text>
<text id="21001402">Until we meet again, my good friend!</text>
<text id="21001403"></text>
<text id="21001500">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="21001501">Not to worry. Great planning begets great fortune.</text>
<text id="21001502">An old tenet of the Knights of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21001503">And I am a master planner, I do say!</text>
<text id="21001504"></text>
<text id="21001600">I'm in quite a pickle indeed.</text>
<text id="21001601">Maybe I can fashion a replacement...from the...hmm</text>
<text id="21001602">I've got to use my head. And think.</text>
<text id="21001603">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21001700"></text>
<text id="21001701"></text>
<text id="21001800"></text>
<text id="21001801">Ah, ohh!</text>
<text id="21001802">Excuse me. I must have dozed off.</text>
<text id="21001803">It's rather warm in here.</text>
<text id="21001804">Well, well, hasn't it been all too long! It's good to see you.</text>
<text id="21001805">Oh, I seemed to have missed my chance, so...</text>
<text id="21001806">I, Siegward of Catarina, offer my deepest gratitude.</text>
<text id="21001807">And a little surprise to go with it. It's all yours.</text>
<text id="21001900">I know. Won't you join me for dinner?</text>
<text id="21001901">I make a fine estus soup. I've got some stewing right now.</text>
<text id="21001902">Even we Undead deserve a little normalcy, from time to time.</text>
<text id="21001903">And finally, upon this rendezvous, let us make a toast.</text>
<text id="21001904">To your valour, my sword, and our sworn duties!</text>
<text id="21001905">Long may the sun shine!</text>
<text id="21001906"></text>
<text id="21002000">Have you heard?</text>
<text id="21002001">Somewhere, hidden right here in Irithyll, is a deep dungeon.</text>
<text id="21002002">And even below that, the Profaned Capital.</text>
<text id="21002003">Home of Yhorm, the reclusive giant lord.</text>
<text id="21002004">That reminds me, I've a grave promise to keep...</text>
<text id="21002100">Oh, sorry, I'm afraid I've cast a cloud over things.</text>
<text id="21002101">Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap.</text>
<text id="21002102">The only thing to do, really, after a nice toast.</text>
<text id="21002103"></text>
<text id="21002200"></text>
<text id="21002201"></text>
<text id="21002202"></text>
<text id="21002300">Hmm...</text>
<text id="21002301">Mmmmmm...</text>
<text id="21002400">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21002401">Ah, oh!</text>
<text id="21002402">Pardon me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="21002403">Look at me, trapped like a rat.</text>
<text id="21002404">But you needn't worry.</text>
<text id="21002405">I've just been sitting here, weighing my options.</text>
<text id="21002406">The moment has almost come.</text>
<text id="21002407">...I just need a bit more time.</text>
<text id="21002500">My liberation requires a key.</text>
<text id="21002501">But the key is outside...</text>
<text id="21002502">Hmm... A riddle for the ages...</text>
<text id="21002600">Ah! You are a saint!</text>
<text id="21002601">Once again, you are my valiant saviour.</text>
<text id="21002602">I, Siegward of Catarina, express my deepest gratitude.</text>
<text id="21002603">Take this, a token of my thanks. Go on, it's all yours.</text>
<text id="21002700">Ah, no, please, go on ahead.</text>
<text id="21002701">I've my own road to take.</text>
<text id="21002702">And a duty to fulfil, very soon...</text>
<text id="21002800">Yhorm, old friend.</text>
<text id="21002801">I, Siegward of the Knights of Catarina, have come to uphold my promise!</text>
<text id="21002802">Let the sun shine upon this Lord of Cinder.</text>
<text id="21002803"></text>
<text id="21002900"></text>
<text id="21002901">It seems I'm in your debt once again.</text>
<text id="21002902">My thanks, I could not have kept my promise without you.</text>
<text id="21002903">Now, for a final toast.</text>
<text id="21002904">To your valour, and my old friend Yhorm.</text>
<text id="21002905">Long may the sun shine!</text>
<text id="21002906"></text>
<text id="21003000">Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap.</text>
<text id="21003001">The only thing to do, really, after a nice toast.</text>
<text id="21003002">You are a true friend. Best of luck with your duty.</text>
<text id="21003100"></text>
<text id="21003101"></text>
<text id="21003102">Forgive me, old friend...</text>
<text id="21003103">I've failed, in everything...</text>
<text id="21003200"></text>
<text id="21003201"></text>
<text id="21003202"></text>
<text id="21003203">What is the meaning of this!</text>
<text id="21003204">What's happened to you!</text>
<text id="21003300">No sense in holding back now.</text>
<text id="21003301">Witness the fury of a Knight of Catarina!</text>
<text id="21003302"></text>
<text id="21003303"></text>
<text id="21003400"></text>
<text id="21003401"></text>
<text id="21003402">How did I ever let this happen...</text>
<text id="21003403">Forgive me, old friend...</text>
<text id="21003500">You were a poor match, friend...</text>
<text id="22000000">Oh dear, another dogged contender.</text>
<text id="22000001">Welcome, Unkindled one, purloiner of cinders.</text>
<text id="22000002">Mind you, the mantle of lord interests me none.</text>
<text id="22000003">The fire-linking curse, the legacy of lords, let it all fade into nothing.</text>
<text id="22000004">Ill-starred are they who take the throne. I shall not stand among them.</text>
<text id="22000005">You've done quite enough, now have your rest.</text>
<text id="22000006">The royal sword of Lothric shall grant you peace.</text>
<text id="22000100">Oh, dear brother...</text>
<text id="22000101">I'm on my way...</text>
<text id="22000102">My brother, unyielding sword of Lothric's Prince.</text>
<text id="22000103">Rise, if you would.</text>
<text id="22000104">...For that is our curse.</text>
<text id="22000200"></text>
<text id="22000201"></text>
<text id="22000202"></text>
<text id="22000300"></text>
<text id="22000301"></text>
<text id="22000302"></text>
<text id="22000400">This spot marks our grave.</text>
<text id="22000401">But you may rest here, too, if you like.</text>
<text id="22000500"></text>
<text id="22000501"></text>
<text id="22000502">Mark my words, Ashen one...</text>
<text id="22000503">You remain among the accursed...</text>
<text id="23000000">Ahh, the wait has been long, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="23000001">I am Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle.</text>
<text id="23000002">Allow me to speak frankly.</text>
<text id="23000003">You will not find the Lords of Cinder here.</text>
<text id="23000004">They have left, gone.</text>
<text id="23000005">To their churning homes, converging at the base of this castle.</text>
<text id="23000006">Head to the bottom of the High Wall.</text>
<text id="23000007">Forge on through the great gate, and raise this banner to proceed.</text>
<text id="23000100">Unkindled One. Head to the High Wall's base.</text>
<text id="23000101">Go through the great gate, and raise this banner to proceed.</text>
<text id="23000102">But beware. The dog keeps a close eye on things.</text>
<text id="23000103">The vile watchdog of the Boreal Valley.</text>
<text id="23000200">What is wrong, Unkindled One?</text>
<text id="23000201">Are you not a Lordseeker? Head to the base of the High Wall and seek the Lords of Cinder.</text>
<text id="23000202">Is this not the calling of your kind, since ages past?</text>
<text id="23000300">Ahh, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="23000301">The fire fades, and awaits its one last Lord.</text>
<text id="23000302">Please, take this...</text>
<text id="23000303">Prince Lothric is in your hands...</text>
<text id="23000304">Please, save his soul.</text>
<text id="23000305">Tell him what he must be. A Lord...</text>
<text id="23000400"></text>
<text id="23000401"></text>
<text id="23000402">A Lord, he must be...</text>
<text id="23000403">My dear Prince...Lothric...</text>
<text id="23000500">This farewell gift is for you.</text>
<text id="23000501">It is the insignia of an old covenant.</text>
<text id="23000502">If you fear tresspassers, dark spirits drawn by the embers.</text>
<text id="23000503">Then etch this upon your heart.</text>
<text id="23000504">And the old concord will beckon noble Blue Sentinels to hunt these foul spirits.</text>
<text id="23000600"></text>
<text id="23000601"></text>
<text id="23000602"></text>
<text id="23000603">What on earth?</text>
<text id="23000604">Whatever is this about?</text>
<text id="24000000">Ahh, you ignorant slaves. Finally taken notice, have you?</text>
<text id="24000001">Of the power of my beloved Ocelotte, child of dragons.</text>
<text id="24000002">Well, I will not give him up.</text>
<text id="24000003">For he is all that I have.</text>
<text id="24000100">Ahh, dear little Ocelotte.</text>
<text id="24000101">Where have you gone? Are you hiding from me?</text>
<text id="24000102">Come out, come out, don't be afraid.</text>
<text id="24000103">You were born a child of dragons, what could you possibly fear?</text>
<text id="24000104">Now, now, show yourself, Ocelotte.</text>
<text id="24000105">My dear, little Ocelotte.</text>
<text id="24000200"></text>
<text id="24000201"></text>
<text id="24000202"></text>
<text id="24000300"></text>
<text id="24000301"></text>
<text id="24000302"></text>
<text id="24000400"></text>
<text id="24000401"></text>
<text id="24000402"></text>
<text id="24000500">Ignorant slaves, how quickly you forget.</text>
<text id="24000501">The strength of dear Ocelotte, child of dragons!</text>
<text id="24000502"></text>
<text id="24000600"></text>
<text id="24000601"></text>
<text id="25000000">Forgive me, don't kill me...</text>
<text id="25000001">A new adventure? No, no need to introduce yourself.</text>
<text id="25000002">Just take my words, Lothric is not a safe place to stay anymore.</text>
<text id="25000003">Run, Or there will be one more corpse. </text>
<text id="25000100">Don't you understand? Staying here has no prons but only cons</text>
<text id="25000101">I have warned you. Then it all depends on your own choice.</text>
<text id="25000102">Just don't draw those kinghts here. </text>
<text id="25000200">Ah, how can I get out of here alive?</text>
<text id="25000300">I finally failed to escape.. Mom</text>
<text id="25000400">No...Please no...</text>
<text id="27000500">Another nana disappeared</text>
<text id="27000501">So the grandson carries a cage</text>
<text id="27000502">He ever has his cage</text>
<text id="27000503">And nana's never coming back</text>
<text id="27000504">So come into the cage, and become nana's shade</text>
<text id="29000000">You, you.</text>
<text id="29000001">Me, me, pickle-pee.</text>
<text id="29000002">Me, me, pump-a-rum.</text>
<text id="29000100">You! You!</text>
<text id="29000101">Me, me, pickle pee!</text>
<text id="29000102">Me, me, pump-a-rum!</text>
<text id="29000200">Pickle pee, pickle pee!</text>
<text id="29000201">Pickle pee, pickle pee!</text>
<text id="29000300">Pump-a-rum, pump-a-rum!</text>
<text id="29000301">Pump-a-rum, pump-a-rum!</text>
<text id="29000400">You, you.</text>
<text id="29000401">No, no.</text>
<text id="29000402">That no pickle pee.</text>
<text id="29000403">That no pump-a-rum.</text>
<text id="29000500">You, you.</text>
<text id="29000501">Not that.</text>
<text id="29000502">Enough, enough.</text>
<text id="30000000">Oh, my, I see you're Unkindled</text>
<text id="30000001">For a pilgrim such as I, all tucked in and awaiting death, to have this honour.</text>
<text id="30000002">This presages a most glorious death indeed.</text>
<text id="30000003">Praise thee, praise thee.</text>
<text id="30000100">Oh, my, you are...!</text>
<text id="30000101">But I'm afraid we require more time.</text>
<text id="30000102">As long as it takes a dark droplet to fall, that is all.</text>
<text id="30000103">Our gracious Lord...</text>
<text id="30000200">Welcome, our gracious Lord.</text>
<text id="30000201">Your spouse awaits you, you are very near.</text>
<text id="30000202">Please, take the Sword of Avowal.</text>
<text id="30000203">May you be the truest Lord of Londor yet.</text>
<text id="30000300">Your spouse awaits you, you are very near.</text>
<text id="30000301">May you be the truest Lord of Londor yet.</text>
<text id="30000400"></text>
<text id="30000401"></text>
<text id="30000402">Whatever for!</text>
<text id="30000500"></text>
<text id="30000501"></text>
<text id="30000502">But, why...</text>
<text id="30000503">Lady Yuria...</text>
<text id="30000600"></text>
<text id="30000601"></text>
<text id="30000602">Ahh, our gracious Lord...</text>
<text id="30000603">Make Londor whole...</text>
<text id="31000000">Well, what's happened here?</text>
<text id="31000001">This pit is for Hollows, not for the likes of you sane folk.</text>
<text id="31000002">Or perhaps you are a Hollow, posing as otherwise?</text>
<text id="31000100"></text>
<text id="31000101">Yes, yes, then we're just fine.</text>
<text id="31000102">It's important to know who you are.</text>
<text id="31000103">But we'll all be mad, soon enough. And should you be Undead, well, all the more so.</text>
<text id="31000200"></text>
<text id="31000201">No, no, of course you're not.</text>
<text id="31000202">That's what you mad fools always say.</text>
<text id="31000203">But we'll all be mad, soon enough. And should you be Undead, well, all the more so.</text>
<text id="31000300">Beware, the shackles of the Gods are fragile.</text>
<text id="31000301">You might need this. Etch it on your heart if you feel your sanity slipping.</text>
<text id="31000302">Come here to pile up your victims, for that will form your anchor.</text>
<text id="31000303">You'll see when you go mad. They'll be your family.</text>
<text id="31000304"></text>
<text id="31000400">You'll go mad one day, but not today.</text>
<text id="31000401">Take my advice. Use this bone, and leave this place.</text>
<text id="31000402">This pit is for Hollows, and for the occasional madman fond of piling up victims.</text>
<text id="31000403">You've better things to do, I'd hope?</text>
<text id="31000404"></text>
<text id="31000500"></text>
<text id="31000600">I knew it, I knew you were Hollow!</text>
<text id="31000601">Well, that's just fine.</text>
<text id="31000602">You can join my little family!</text>
<text id="31000603"></text>
<text id="31000700">Right, onto the pile with you. You're family now...</text>
<text id="31000800"></text>
<text id="31000801"></text>
<text id="31000802">Ahh, my family...</text>
<text id="31000803">Dear little Sirris...</text>
<text id="50000000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="50000100">I help anytime.</text>
