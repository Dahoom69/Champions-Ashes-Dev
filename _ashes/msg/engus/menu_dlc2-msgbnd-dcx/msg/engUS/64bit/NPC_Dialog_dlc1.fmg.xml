<text id="4005000">Ahh, thy scent beseems most familiar.</text>
<text id="4005001">A sweet fragrance, long faded from our own bosoms.</text>
<text id="4005002">How this came to pass I know not, but...</text>
<text id="4005003">Take heed. Kindness can wear upon one's principles.</text>
<text id="4005100">Ahh, our Lord and rightful Liege.</text>
<text id="4005101">Thy scent seemeth most familiar.</text>
<text id="4005102">A sweet fragrance, long faded from our own bosoms.</text>
<text id="4005103">My Lord, how this came to pass I know not, but...</text>
<text id="4005104">Take heed. Kindness can wear upon one's principles...</text>
<text id="4005200">Might that soul be...</text>
<text id="4005201">Nay. Nevermind.</text>
<text id="4005202">It belongs to a woman from Londor.</text>
<text id="4005203">To provide succour for the Lord of Hollows surely would bring her much honour</text>
<text id="4005204">In return, thou needst only do her a small kindness</text>
<text id="4005205">Remember those who stayed by her to the end, in the shadows cast by fire...</text>
<text id="4005300">Ahh, our Lord and Liege.</text>
<text id="4005301">Twas the soul of my sister.</text>
<text id="4005302">Elfriede... A poor wench turned to Ash, who would abandon Londor...</text>
<text id="4005303">If thou wouldst, let it nourish thy Lordship.</text>
<text id="4005304">And in return, do her one small kindness.</text>
<text id="4005305">Remember those who stayed by her to the end, in the shadows cast by fire...</text>
<text id="4005306">And lastly, my Lord, take up thy rightful mantle, of usurper.</text>
<text id="51000000">Ahh, merciful goddess, mother of the Forlorn, who have no place to call their own...</text>
<text id="51000001">Please, bear witness to our resolve...</text>
<text id="51000002">Fire for Ariandel... Fire for Ariandel...</text>
<text id="51000003">And the ash to kindle flame...</text>
<text id="51000004"></text>
<text id="51000100">Wait, you've...</text>
<text id="51000101">You've the same scent as that woman...</text>
<text id="51000102">Then you must be an Ashen One. You must be!</text>
<text id="51000103"></text>
<text id="51000104">You don't know how long I've searched!</text>
<text id="51000105"></text>
<text id="51000200">Ohh, ohh...don't mind me, didn't mean to fall apart.</text>
<text id="51000201">Now, Ashen One, I have a kindness to ask of you.</text>
<text id="51000202">My lady lives in the cold land of Ariandel.</text>
<text id="51000203">I need you to show her flame.</text>
<text id="51000204">A proper flame, that will burn the rot away.</text>
<text id="51000205">If you truly are Ash, then it must be fire that you seek?</text>
<text id="51000300">Ahh, thank you. They of Ash never fail.</text>
<text id="51000301">...Just a moment, then...</text>
<text id="51000302">The painting of Ariandel. Well, rotted scrap of it, that is.</text>
<text id="51000303">Go on, take it, touch it...</text>
<text id="51000304"></text>
<text id="51000305">And then, the Ashes were two.</text>
<text id="51000306"></text>
<text id="51000400">Oh. Are you certain of that?</text>
<text id="51000401">Hogwash, hogwash. What Ash does not seek fire?</text>
<text id="51000402"></text>
<text id="51000500">Ahh, you again, I knew it.</text>
<text id="51000501">As any Ash seeks fire, you will surely help me!</text>
<text id="51000502">My lady lives in the cold land of Ariandel.</text>
<text id="51000503">I need you to show her flame.</text>
<text id="51000504">A proper flame, that will burn the rot away.</text>
<text id="51000505">You will thank me when it's done...</text>
<text id="51000600">(Assorted damage sounds. Screams of an old, exhausted knight. Winces/sounds of bearing pain)</text>
<text id="51000700">Please, stop...</text>
<text id="51000701">I beg of you, please, stop.</text>
<text id="51000702">My work is not yet done.</text>
<text id="51000703">I am no foe of yours... Please, stop...</text>
<text id="51000800">What in blazes...</text>
<text id="51000801">Well, I suppose you are Ash...</text>
<text id="51000802">(damage sound)</text>
<text id="51000803">Yes, of course, as all Ash should be!</text>
<text id="51000900">(several cries of death)</text>
<text id="51001000">Ahh, fire for Ariandel...</text>
<text id="51001001">Show my lady...flame...</text>
<text id="51001002"></text>
<text id="51001100">If you truly are Ash, you will seek fire...</text>
<text id="51001101">To set Ariandel ablaze...</text>
<text id="51001102"></text>
<text id="51001200">Dear me, why would you do such a thing?</text>
<text id="51001201">Oh...the scent of that woman...</text>
<text id="51001300">Dear me, why would you do such a thing?</text>
<text id="51001301">No matter, it's hardly the first time.</text>
<text id="51001302">More importantly, I've a service to ask of you, Ashen One...</text>
<text id="51001400">Dear me, why would you do such a thing?</text>
<text id="51001401">Dreadful Ash, through and through...</text>
<text id="52000000">Well...</text>
<text id="52000001">You look to be Unkindled.</text>
<text id="52000002">No bell tolls, and yet, you've slipped into the painting?</text>
<text id="52000003">Oh, no matter.</text>
<text id="52000004">If you've lost your way, the words of Lady Friede will guide you.</text>
<text id="52000005">Now, go on ahead. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000006">Now, go on inside. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000100">What's keeping you? Go on, straight ahead.</text>
<text id="52000101">What's keeping you? Go on, right inside.</text>
<text id="52000102">Show respect, and let Lady Friede speak to you.</text>
<text id="52000200">Lady Friede has spoken, has she not?</text>
<text id="52000201">Then tarry no longer and begone.</text>
<text id="52000300">There is one thing you should know.</text>
<text id="52000301">Inside the cold painting, curiosity could be your cross...</text>
<text id="52000302">Stray from the withering flame, and the snow will swallow you whole.</text>
<text id="52000303"></text>
<text id="52000400">Why you miserable, mad Hollow.</text>
<text id="52000401">You're nothing, without a bell to guide your way.</text>
<text id="52000402"></text>
<text id="52000500">Well, well...</text>
<text id="52000501">You're Lady Yuria's Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="52000502">No bell tolls, and yet, you've slipped into the painting?</text>
<text id="52000503">Oh, no matter.</text>
<text id="52000504">If you've lost your way, the words of Lady Friede will guide you.</text>
<text id="52000505">Now, go on ahead. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000506">Now, go on inside. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000600">Lady Friede has spoken, has she not?</text>
<text id="52000601">Then tarry no longer and begone.</text>
<text id="52000602">Carry on, for Lady Yuria, and for Londor.</text>
<text id="52000700">Why you miserable, mad Hollow.</text>
<text id="52000701">What is Lady Yuria thinking...</text>
<text id="52000800">I've seen your kind, time and time again.</text>
<text id="52000801">Every fleeing man must be caught. Every secret must be unearthed.
Such is the conceit of the self-proclaimed seeker of truth.</text>
<text id="52000802">But in the end, you lack the stomach.</text>
<text id="52000803">For the agony that you'll bring upon yourself...</text>
<text id="52000900">(Various attack sounds. She wields a large straight sword and a flaming flamberge)</text>
<text id="52000901">(Various damage sounds.)</text>
<text id="52001000">(Several death cries)</text>
<text id="52001100">Forgive me, my Lady...</text>
<text id="52001101">I swore an oath, but I have failed you...</text>
<text id="52001102">...Lady Elfriede...</text>
<text id="52001200">I trust you've learned your lesson...</text>
<text id="52001201">Inside the cold painting, curiosity could be your cross...</text>
<text id="53000000">I believe...I feel the scent of ash upon thee.</text>
<text id="53000001">Thou'rt the one of whom uncle Gael spoke.</text>
<text id="53000002">The one to show me flame.</text>
<text id="53000100">Tis good. When this is done, may I return.</text>
<text id="53000101">The door is open thanks to thee.</text>
<text id="53000200">Tis good. I'll head off to paint.</text>
<text id="53000201">I promised uncle Gael I would.</text>
<text id="53000300">Worry not,</text>
<text id="53000301">I cannot die.</text>
<text id="53000400">Thou'rt Ash.</text>
<text id="53000401">Thou'st a pact made with uncle Gael.</text>
<text id="53000402">So I wish to tell thee all.</text>
<text id="53000403">Behold its size. This is my canvas.</text>
<text id="53000404">It's to be a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000405">...But first, I must see flame.</text>
<text id="53000500">I wish to paint a picture.</text>
<text id="53000501">Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000502">One day, it will make someone a goodly home.</text>
<text id="53000503">That's why I must see flame.</text>
<text id="53000600">Those who aren't ken to fire cannot paint a world.</text>
<text id="53000601">Those absorbed by fire, must not paint a world.</text>
<text id="53000602">Don't worry, I haven't forgotten, Mother...</text>
<text id="53000700">I can hear the fire crackle...</text>
<text id="53000701">And soon, I will see it...</text>
<text id="53000800">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="53000801">I will finish the painting.</text>
<text id="53000802">Of a cold, dark, and very gentle place.</text>
<text id="53000803">So that it might make a home for someone, someday.</text>
<text id="53000900">My thanks, Ashen One.</text>
<text id="53000901">I can almost see the flame.</text>
<text id="53000902">Soon uncle Gael will bring me the pigment.</text>
<text id="53000903">I wonder if he has found it?</text>
<text id="53000904">The dark soul of man...</text>
<text id="53001000">I wonder if uncle Gael has found it?</text>
<text id="53001001">The dark soul of man...</text>

<text id="53001301">I have a world to paint.</text>
<text id="54000000">Hmm, well, there's nothing forlorn about you.</text>
<text id="54000001">You must be the other Ash, I suppose?</text>
<text id="54000100">Ohh, ohh, finally, you've come!</text>
<text id="54000101">Oh wondrous Ash, grant us our wish.</text>
<text id="54000102">Make the tales true, and burn this world away.</text>
<text id="54000103">My Lady must see flame, and you have only to show her.</text>
<text id="54000104">You are Ash, are you not? Is it not fire that you seek?</text>
<text id="54000200">Surely you've seen. The rot that afflicts our world.</text>
<text id="54000201">But that witch fooled the good Father, and buried the flame.</text>
<text id="54000202">After we had all made up our minds, too.</text>
<text id="54000203">So, please, grant us one wish.</text>
<text id="54000204">Make the tales true, and burn this world away.</text>
<text id="54000205">My Lady must see flame, and you have only to show her.</text>
<text id="54000300">Oh, please, it must be you.</text>
<text id="54000301">I'm so terribly frightened, of timidly rotting away...</text>
<text id="54000302">Like those... Like those fools on the outside.</text>
<text id="54000400">Well, that's a rotten shame.</text>
<text id="54000401">I've been very patient, you see.</text>
<text id="54000402">The tales tell of two Ashes, who'll burn Ariandel away.</text>
<text id="54000403">And we need only one more...</text>
<text id="54000500">Ahh, yes, well...</text>
<text id="54000501">I was hoping you might be the other Ash, you see...</text>
<text id="54000600">Ohhh, my, thank you.</text>
<text id="54000601">I can hear the crackling from here.</text>
<text id="54000602">The sound of my home, the painting of Ariandel, burning away...</text>
<text id="54000700">When the world rots, we set it afire. For the sake of the next world.</text>
<text id="54000701">It's the one thing we do right, unlike those fools on the outside.</text>
