<text id="1376000">A memory of an old sword found deep within Midir.
This sorcery uses souls to grant form to the
thought, and attack with it.

Attacks are coupled with lightwaves,
and sustaining the stance before attacking
increases their speed and potency.

The sword is named after moonlight, but it is
slightly different than the one fashioned of the
paledrake Seath. Perhaps it is rooted in an
older memory, from not long after the Beginning.</text>
<text id="1604000">A sorcery that fires great dark soul dregs
that have stewed for ages, far within the deep.

This sorcery is the highest form of Deep Soul.

Some of the murkmen who rise from the depths
are possessed by soul dregs, which have a
grave likeness to the human form.</text>
<text id="2458000">Pyromancy of Zoey, descendant of the desert
pyromancers.

Use repeatedly to brush the fan of flame left
and right.

Zoey possessed true beauty, as did all the
desert pyromancers, but hers did not poison,
and so she became the unassuming queen
of the feeble ones. </text>
<text id="2660000">The last flame lit by the demon prince.
This pyromancy hurls a clump of chaos.

Upon impact, this clump of chaos seethes wildly,
condenses briefly, then explodes violently.

To the demons, these clumps are shreds of life.</text>
<text id="3509000">The few female knights who served in the age of
the gods used this miracle for dragonslaying.

Draw lightning bow to fire a lightning arrow.

The lightning arrows offer a great improvement
to the range of spears, and were said to have been used to pierce the eyes of dragons from afar.
But remember, beautiful stories are always
marked by embellishment.

<text id="3557000">A miracle discovered in the last days of Lothric.
Toss a light that heals those near the point of impact.

Even those who had forgotten the caress and bounty of the Princess of Sunlight did their best to recall her image. The stories spun about her were most certainly childish, and yet gravely sincere.</text>
