<text id="64520000">The head of an abominable being from the East.

It covers most of the face and is designed with multiple slits, thereby allowing a wanderer to mask his identity and travel undistracted by sights around him on his journey.

The discovery of this armor is curious indeed, and it is unclear whether these pursuers still roam the land or one’s calling for atonement led him down a different path.</text>

but some decided to take up arms, determined to defend their cold home from an inevitable fate. </text>

Using this soul, he fragmented it, fathering humanity. 

After the end of the war against the everlasting dragons, the First Lord granted humanity the Ringed City as a place to call home. 

This crown is a symbol of humanity itself. Those who bear it are paragons of human-kind, and therefore darkness.</text>

As the Matriarch of the Church of Londor, Filianore ruled over the Ringed City.
But now she lays dormant with no signs of awakening. If someone were to wake her, however, no one knows what doom they would call upon themselves.</text>
