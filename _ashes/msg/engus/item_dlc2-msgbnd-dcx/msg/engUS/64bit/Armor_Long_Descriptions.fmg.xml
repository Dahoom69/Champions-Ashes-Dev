<text id="64651000">A brutish, hulking mass of armor.

It bore the mission of indomitable knights who relentlessly pursued bearers of the undead curse, even beyond death.

The discovery of this armor is curious indeed, and it is unclear whether these pursuers still roam the land or one’s calling for atonement led him down a different path.</text>

<text id="64660000">Helm of the Corvian Knights of Ariandel.

This rare helmet is made to fit the twisted facial structure of a crow-like being with a long and sharp beak.

The corvians who live within the painting wish for nothing but peace in their gentle haven,
but some decided to take up arms, determined to defend their cold home from an inevitable fate. </text>
<text id="64670000">Helmet fashioned from the head of a giant crab.

<text id="64680000">Crown of the Furtive Pygmy, bearer of the Dark Soul.

Using this soul, he fragmented it, fathering humanity. 

After the end of the war against the everlasting dragons, the First Lord granted humanity the Ringed City as a place to call home. 

This crown is a symbol of humanity itself. Those who bear it are paragons of human-kind, and therefore darkness.</text>
<text id="64690000">Crown of Filianore, youngest daughter of Gwyn, Lord of Cinder.

As the Matriarch of the Church of Londor, Filianore ruled over the Ringed City.
But now she lays dormant with no signs of awakening. If someone were to wake her, however, no one knows what doom they would call upon themselves.</text>
<text id="64700000">A hooded mask with a beak worn by priests.

<text id="64710000">An atypical mask worn by Lothric soldiers.

Used more broadly during Lothric's era of dragon hunting, this helmet has become somewhat rare in current times.

The hinge attaching the faceplate to the helm seems to have been melted shut, restraining the user from lifting it, but also providing sound defense.</text>
<text id="64720000">A strange mask depicting the visage of an old man.

The expression of this old man oozes anger, or perhaps concern.

His beard is long and white, fit for an elderly war hero.</text>

Even in the hardest of times, a fool can always scrape the bottom of the barrel for some ill-suited courage. </text>
<text id="64740000">Brilliant metal cone that might be mistaken for some kind of ornament or decoration. 

Upon closer inspection it seems there is an opening at the bottom of this object, one shaped as if to fit a human head.

Practical matters, such as descending ladders or being able to see, are not of relevance to the sort of people that wear such a curious helmet.</text>

<text id="99570000">Helmet of an indentured knight from a far-off land mired in heretics and cultists.

The stout helmet provides solid defense, but leaves the wearer almost devoid of their senses.

Donning the helmet, faint mutterings of ritualistic prayer can occasionally be heard. Straining to listen only serves to make the whispers grow quiet.</text>
<text id="99571000">The sturdy plating easily shrugs off physical attacks, seemingly as solid as rock.

Tattered remnants of an insignia adorn the metal. Such metalworking is rarely seen in the lands of Lothric, even among the elites. While stout, small openings are required to let the armor move freely. These openings allow quick thrusting weapons to pierce the flesh underneath.

The armor sometimes shifts, seemingly of its own accord, oftentimes feeling as if there is another marionetting the plates of steel.</text>
<text id="99572000">Solid gauntlets that fit like a second skin. They grip with an otherworldly strength. 

Thin scratches and scuffs from battles past scar the metal. But the palms seem to be without imperfections, as if the previous wearer held another form of protection while swinging their weapon.</text>
