<text id="241">Holy water blessed by the Queen of Lothric.

<text id="270">Red moss clump used as maggot repellent.

blades or spikes, and once triggered causes
severe damage. Use this moss clump before
it reaches that point.</text>
<text id="271">Medicinal purple moss clump.
Reduces poison build-up. Cures poison.

Poison builds up in the body, and when it
breaks out, it causes gradual damage over
a period of time.

Poison can be exasperating, so be sure to carry sufficient moss clumps when traveling to a blighted area.</text>
<text id="272">Potently medicinal moss clump with a flower.
Reduces poison and toxin. Cures ailments.

A toxin is a more vicious form of poison which
quickly leads to death.

Moss clumps without blooms are useless against toxin, and those who neglect to carry this flowered variety are simply courting an early demise.</text>

<text id="274">Ash-colored stone encasing a skull.

Reduces undead curse build-up and cures hollowing.

Inhabitants of Londor, the land of Hollows, use this secret treasure to feign normalcy.

<text id="276">Moss clump radiating gentle heat and light.
Reduces frost build-up. Cures frostbite status.

Frost accumulates in the body causing frostbite, which saps one's health, lowers absorption, and slows stamina recovery.

Weapons imbued with frost are a rare thing indeed, most of them originating in the Boreal Valley.</text>
<text id="277">A blessed charm.
Cures poison and restores HP.

Many such charms were blessed in
reconstructed ancient ceremonies, carried out
in the monastery of Lindelt, now known as
the new home of miracles.

in circumstances dire enough,
an imitation can be quite enough.</text>

Explodes, inflicting fire damage.

Fire damage, which differs from physical damage, is highly effective against creatures of flesh, beasts, and other foes that might naturally have cause to fear the flame.</text>
<text id="293">Dried fecal waste material, moist on the inside.

Throw at enemy to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Though the stench makes it difficult to carry on one's person, inflicting toxins on an enemy yields high damage over time. Perhaps some Undead have fond memories of waste. Or, perhaps not.</text>
<text id="294">A skull resplendent in the scent of souls. Prepared by evangelists of the Cathedral of the Deep.

Throw to shatter, spreading souls which attract enemies. Not effective for all foes.</text>

<text id="296">Tool used to hunt down the Undead.

Used long ago by Lloyd's cleric knights on their Undead hunts. Although Allfather Lloyd is long forgotten by the Way of White, his hunts have lived on, and this charm allows one to challenge Undead without fear of tenacious healing.</text>
<text id="297">More powerful bisque urn filled with special black

<text id="299">Bisque urn attached to a string and filled with black powder. Thrown behind and explodes, inflicting fire damage.

the direction in which it is thrown. Enables
a different fighting style, and flexibility in
adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="300">Dragon-hunting tool used by Lothric knights.
Explodes upon contact, inflicting lightning damage.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons,
but were once hunters of dragons themselves.

This explains their special hunting gear, and why
they worshipped the sun.</text>
<text id="301">An urn filled with crystal-clear water.
Originally intended as a soothing potion,
this water scalds the skin of Undead and Hollows.

In the old capital of Mirrah, an ancient,
well-protected spring produces holy water,
but the water has been difficult to acquire
ever since Mirrah became embroiled in war.</text>
<text id="302">Black bisque urn attached to a string and filled

inflicting fire damage.

No different to a black firebomb, save for
the direction in which it is thrown. Enables

adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="303">Dried fecal waste material, marked by a long
plant stalk that was not properly digested.

Throw behind at enemies to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Strictly speaking, this consists of different
material than the dung pie, but waste is waste,
no sense in splitting hairs.</text>
<text id="304">Tool used in duels of judgment. Nulls effects
of special area effects for a short time.

Allfather Lloyd's knights lived in fear of his duels
of judgment, in which verdicts were carried out by
his Sword of Law.</text>
<text id="305">An unusually tough, grey mound of unknown material, cold to the touch. It is reminiscent of Havel the Rock.
Old tales from far off lands depict this bizarre object as a historic element predating the age of ancients.

Surely an oddity such as this ball is worth unscrupulous amounts of kingly currency!

Use: Throw item at target, shattering it upon impact.
What person would perform this calibre of outlandish brutality? Perhaps it is better used for defense.</text>
<text id="306">The gloves of an executioner from a faraway land.

Passed from executioner father to executioner son, these gloves can be used to summon wrathful spirits of the past by smearing them with blood.

It is said that the nobles the executioner served found immeasurable delight in the dances of these vengeful spectres.</text>
<text id="307">Dragon-hunting tool attached to a string.
Thrown behind and explodes, inflicting lightning damage.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons, but were once hunters of dragons themselves.

No different to a lightning urn, save for the direction in which it is thrown. Enables a different fighting style, and flexibility in adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="308">Skull of a local from a violated fishing village. The inside of the skull was forcibly searched for eyes, as evidenced by innumerable scratches and indentations.

<text id="334">Charcoal pine resin rotted with human body fluids.

The blood red substance sometimes found within suggests there is more to this so-called resin than meets the eye.</text>
<text id="337">A glowing vial that hums with energy.

Temporarily applies thunder to right hand weapon.

The alchemists of the Vinheim Dragon School took an interest in the curious energy laying dormant in Thunder Papers and soon began their experiments.

<text id="338">A small bundle of charcoal pine resin rotted with human body fluids.

Quickly applies dark to right-hand weapon.

This paper originates from a far-off land, where instead of the gods, there are tales of terrible monstrosities that weave and hunt with the same energy these papers produce.</text>
<text id="343">Pine resin that has rotted and turned poisonous.
Likely rotten from the start.

Temporarily applies poison to right-hand weapon.

Return to last bonfire used for resting,

Bonfires are sustained by bones of the Undead.
In rare cases, their previous owner's strong urge to seek bonfires enchants their bones with a homeward instinct.</text>
<text id="351">Fragment of the coiled sword of a bonfire
which served its purpose long ago.

Returns caster to last bonfire used for resting,

</text>
<text id="366">A leaf signifying a duty fulfilled by the Watchdogs of Farron, who stand beside the old wolf to ensure the serenity of those at rest. Depicts a swordgrass leaf stained with dried blood.

Long ago, the swordgrass leaf quietly identified members of the Undead Legion. In the rotted forest rest the spirits of warriors past, their acceptance of and gratitude toward their guardians is expressed eloquently by the humble leaf.</text>
<text id="367">Proof of a duty fulfilled by the Aldrich Faithful,
who patiently await the Devourer of Gods' return.

Dregs are the heaviest things within the human body,
and will sink to the lowest depths imaginable,
where they become the shackles that bind this world.

</text>
<text id="368">Proof that a red eye orb invader successfully fended off a blue spirit.

Those who hunt dark spirits take the names of gods in ancient accord with the Way of Blue, a deception exemplified by their forked tongues.

Use to acquire two Pale Tongues.</text>

<text id="372">Blood-drained, shrunken ear.
Souvenir taken for subduing the guilty.

The knights called the Blades of the Darkmoon
punish the guilt-soaked offenders of the Gods
and take this as proof of their conquest.
The earless corpses of the guilty will be
left behind as a warning to others, inspiring
both fear and respect for the Gods. Such is
the eternal mandate of the Dark Sun.</text>
<text id="373">Proof of a red orb invader's victory over a Host of Embers.
