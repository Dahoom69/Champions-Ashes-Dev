Have faith her soul can be retrieved, by invading
the world of her killer, and returning victorious.

The Black Eye is proof of vengeance, but often

<text id="117">The Darksign is the sign of an accursed Undead.

The Darksign returns its bearer to the last bonfire
rested at, or the bonfire at Firelink Shrine,
but at the cost of all souls held.

Carriers of the Darksign are reborn after death,
and eventually lose their minds, turning Hollow.
And so it is they are driven from their homelands.</text>

<text id="240">Holy water blessed by the Queen of Lothric.

Fully restores HP and cures ailments.

The Queen of Lothric, married to the former King Oceiros, was initially revered as a goddess of fertility and bounty. After giving birth to Ocelotte, her youngest, she quietly disappeared.</text>
<text id="241">Holy water blessed by the Queen of Lothric.

Fully restores FP.

There is a grave in Lothric that sees no visitors, a dark place where rootless warriors rest. The Queen of Lothric alone cared to wish the poor souls good fortune.</text>
<text id="242">Silver pendant engraved with
the crest of Artorias.

One of the ancient treasures of Anor Londo.
Presented to Artorias for facing the Abyss.

Effectively deflects the Dark of the Abyss,
especially in its magic forms.</text>
<text id="260">Green weed, shaped like a flower.
Temporary boost to stamina recovery speed.

The Undead Legion of Farron are remembered for using this annual plant, normally found near clear water, to swing their mighty swords with abandon.
</text>
<text id="261">Green flower-shaped weed with small white blooms.

Large temporary boost to stamina recovery speed.

Flowers of the Green Blossom are ethereal, blossoming only on the surface of chilled,
but not frozen, water.</text>
<text id="262">Green flower-shaped weed with small white blooms.

Large temporary boost to stamina recovery speed.

The brief attached messages suggests that it was
a gift:

"Good-bye, dear Grandmother.
I will visit Grandfather, in the Pit of Hollows."</text>
<text id="263">A medicinal herb used by the soldiers and doctors of Londor, named after the lunar phase.

Recovers 5% +120 HP, increasing stamina regeneration by 30 for ten seconds.

Often mass produced, it is taken and sold by nomadic merchants to other armies.</text>

<text id="270">Red moss clump used as maggot repellent.

Reduces bleeding build-up.

Bleeding builds up when attacked by sharp
blades or spikes, and once triggered causes
severe damage. Use this moss clump before
it reaches that point.</text>
<text id="271">Medicinal purple moss clump.
Reduces poison build-up. Cures poison.

Poison builds up in the body, and when it
breaks out, it causes gradual damage over
a period of time.

Poison can be exasperating, so be sure to carry sufficient moss clumps when traveling to a blighted area.</text>
<text id="272">Potently medicinal moss clump with a flower.
Reduces poison and toxin. Cures ailments.

A toxin is a more vicious form of poison which
quickly leads to death.

Moss clumps without blooms are useless against toxin, and those who neglect to carry this flowered variety are simply courting an early demise.</text>
<text id="273">%null%</text>
<text id="274">Ash-colored stone encasing a skull.

Reduces undead curse build-up and cures hollowing.

Inhabitants of Londor, the land of Hollows, use this secret treasure to feign normalcy.

Occasionally, a Hollow fools even himself, and turns on his own kind.</text>
<text id="275">%null%</text>
<text id="276">Moss clump radiating gentle heat and light.
Reduces frost build-up. Cures frostbite status.

Frost accumulates in the body causing frostbite, which saps one's health, lowers absorption, and slows stamina recovery.

Weapons imbued with frost are a rare thing indeed, most of them originating in the Boreal Valley.</text>
<text id="277">A blessed charm.
Cures poison and restores HP.

Many such charms were blessed in
reconstructed ancient ceremonies, carried out
in the monastery of Lindelt, now known as
the new home of miracles.

Though it may lack the power of an original,
in circumstances dire enough,
an imitation can be quite enough.</text>

<text id="280">Lightly enchanted golden powder.

Repairs equipped weapons and armor, as long as they haven't already broken.

Use of a weapon depletes its durability,
eventually causing it to break.

As long as a weapon is not broken, its durability can be restored at a bonfire, but for distant journeys, one may wish to prepare ahead.</text>

<text id="285">A special Carcosan molotov that when thrown wedges itself into an object. Explodes on a timed delay.

What's made notable by this tool is its complex timer mechanism being wasted after each use. It is a shame to know that what could have been a technological marvel is used simply for bombs.</text>
<text id="286">A special Carcosan molotov that when thrown from behind wedges itself into an object. Explodes on a timed delay.

What's made notable by this tool is its complex timer mechanism being wasted after each use. It is a shame to know that what could have been a technological marvel is used simply for bombs.</text>
<text id="287">Explodes in raging flames when thrown against an object. One of the oldest ways to fight various beasts.

Since the tragedy of Carcosa, a neighbor to Lothric, its refugees came bearing gifts such as these marvelous yet simple explosives.</text>
<text id="288">Exploding Molotov cocktail that is thrown behind.

Allows for more maneuvering compared to an ordinary Molotov cocktail, and can catch foes off guard.

Since the tragedy of Carcosa, a neighbor to Lothric, its refugees came bearing gifts such as these marvelous yet simple explosives.</text>

<text id="290">Small throwing machete.
Throw at enemies to cause bleeding damage.

A unique weapon originally used by swordsmen
of Carthus, but now popular among bandits
and thieves.</text>
<text id="291">A small clay urn filled with oil-infused material. Shatters upon contact, drenching target in highly combustible mixture, making them heavily susceptible to the next intake of fire damage.

Incapable of dealing direct damage, infantrymen mainly employed this tool to support from the sides. But the supply soon failed to meet the demand of war, as the workers of Undead Settlement need to hoard their oil production to deal with the taxing business of undead burial.</text>
<text id="292">Bisque urn filled with black powder.
Explodes, inflicting fire damage.

Fire damage, which differs from physical damage, is highly effective against creatures of flesh, beasts, and other foes that might naturally have cause to fear the flame.</text>
<text id="293">Dried fecal waste material, moist on the inside.

Throw at enemy to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Though the stench makes it difficult to carry on one's person, inflicting toxins on an enemy yields high damage over time. Perhaps some Undead have fond memories of waste. Or, perhaps not.</text>
<text id="294">A skull resplendent in the scent of souls. Prepared by evangelists of the Cathedral of the Deep.

Throw to shatter, spreading souls which attract enemies. Not effective for all foes.</text>
<text id="295">%null%</text>
<text id="296">Tool used to hunt down the Undead.
Blocks Estus recovery within a limited area.

Used long ago by Lloyd's cleric knights on their Undead hunts. Although Allfather Lloyd is long forgotten by the Way of White, his hunts have lived on, and this charm allows one to challenge Undead without fear of tenacious healing.</text>
<text id="297">More powerful bisque urn filled with special black
powder. Explodes, inflicting great fire damage.

Fire damage, which differs from physical damage, is highly effective against creatures of flesh, beasts, and other foes that might naturally have cause to fear the flame.</text>
<text id="298">%null%</text>
<text id="299">Bisque urn attached to a string and filled with black powder. Thrown behind and explodes, inflicting fire damage.

No different to a firebomb, save for
the direction in which it is thrown. Enables
a different fighting style, and flexibility in
adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="300">Dragon-hunting tool used by Lothric knights.
Explodes upon contact, inflicting lightning damage.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons,
but were once hunters of dragons themselves.

This explains their special hunting gear, and why
they worshipped the sun.</text>
<text id="301">An urn filled with crystal-clear water.
Originally intended as a soothing potion,
this water scalds the skin of Undead and Hollows.

In the old capital of Mirrah, an ancient,
well-protected spring produces holy water,
but the water has been difficult to acquire
ever since Mirrah became embroiled in war.</text>
<text id="302">Black bisque urn attached to a string and filled
with black powder. Thrown behind and explodes,
inflicting fire damage.

No different to a black firebomb, save for
the direction in which it is thrown. Enables
a different fighting style, and flexibility in
adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="303">Dried fecal waste material, marked by a long
plant stalk that was not properly digested.

Throw behind at enemies to inflict toxin build-up,
but also ups your own toxicity.

Strictly speaking, this consists of different
material than the dung pie, but waste is waste,
no sense in splitting hairs.</text>
<text id="304">Tool used in duels of judgment. Nulls effects
of special area effects for a short time.

Allfather Lloyd's knights lived in fear of his duels
of judgment, in which verdicts were carried out by
his Sword of Law.</text>
<text id="305">An unusually tough, grey mound of unknown material, cold to the touch. It is reminiscent of Havel the Rock.
Old tales from far off lands depict this bizarre object as a historic element predating the age of ancients.

Surely an oddity such as this ball is worth unscrupulous amounts of kingly currency!

Use: Throw item at target, shattering it upon impact.
What person would perform this calibre of outlandish brutality? Perhaps it is better used for defense.</text>
<text id="306">The gloves of an executioner from the Undead Settlement, though quite dated.

Passed through executioner lineage, smearing blood across the gloves will summon the wraiths of the executioner's victims.

It is said that the executioners put on shows for the Settlement, the citizens taking a sadistic delight in the pained writhing of the vengeful spirits.</text>
<text id="307">Dragon-hunting tool attached to a string.
Thrown behind and explodes, inflicting lightning damage.

The knights of Lothric have since tamed dragons, but were once hunters of dragons themselves.

No different to a lightning urn, save for the direction in which it is thrown. Enables a different fighting style, and flexibility in adjusting to one's circumstances.</text>
<text id="308">Skull of a local fisherman who was violated before death.

The inside of the skull was forcibly rearranged, as evidenced by the innumerable scratches and indentations. No wonder the skull became stewed in curses, as the fisherman could not be reborn.

The fisherman's vengeful spirit lives on within the skull, forever tormenting the madmen who stifled him.</text>
<text id="309">%null%</text>
<text id="310">Small throwing knife.
Throw at enemies to inflict damage.

Most items choose their wielder, and only
experience can improve their effectiveness.
True strength can be gained in no other way.</text>
<text id="311">A throwing knife dipped in poison.
Throw at enemies to inflict poison damage.

Used by assassins of Londor, land of Hollows.
The poison is jokingly known as Hollow's blood.</text>
<text id="312">Throwing knife chiseled from glintstone, an otherworldly material.

Consumes FP. Throw at enemies to deal magic damage and build frostbite.

Used by warlocks who are unable to attune to their glintstone catalysts.
Jokingly called an "improvised sorcery", along with the rocks they throw with reckless abandon.</text>
<text id="330">Black charcoal-like pine resin.
Temporarily applies fire to right-hand weapon.

Used in the Undead Settlement to preserve
Undead bodies after dissection, and to bury them.</text>
<text id="331">Rare pine resin which emits golden sparks.
Chunks of it are even rarer.

Temporarily applies lightning to right-hand weapon.

Its origins are unknown, although some have
speculated that it may in fact be a type of
fungal resin.</text>
<text id="332">%null%</text>
<text id="333">%null%</text>
<text id="334">Charcoal pine resin rotted with human body fluids.

Temporarily applies dark to right-hand weapon.

Normally used in the Undead Settlement for preservation and burials, but can mature into this state, becoming a valuable substance, used in a certain ceremony. Often seen for trade at exorbitant prices.</text>
<text id="335">Highly viscous scarlet plant secretions.

Temporarily applies bleeding effect to right-hand weapon.

Associated with the warriors of Carthus, whose blades take on the scarlet hues of both this sanguine substance and the spatters of their victims' blood.</text>
<text id="336">Pale pine resin that faintly glimmers.

Temporarily applies magic to right-hand weapon.

The blood red substance sometimes found within suggests there is more to this so-called resin than meets the eye.</text>
<text id="337">A glowing vial that hums with energy.

Temporarily applies thunder to right hand weapon.

The alchemists of the Vinheim Dragon School took an interest in the curious energy laying dormant in Thunder Papers and soon began their experiments. 
After much trial and error, the first batch was produced and distributed among the sorcerors of Vinheim, the methods utilized in its creation still remaining a tightly guarded secret.</text>
<text id="338">A small bundle of charcoal pine resin rotted with human body fluids.

Quickly applies dark to right-hand weapon.

Does not last for long, but can be used in inventive ways, such as applying it in the middle of a series of blows.</text>
<text id="339">A small bundle of pale pine resin that faintly glimmers.

<text id="341">Rare pine resin which emits golden sparks.
Collected in a small bundle.

Quickly applies lightning to right-hand weapon.

Does not last for long, but can be used in inventive ways, such as applying it in the middle of a series of blows.</text>
<text id="342">Coarse paper that emits blue sparks.

Quickly applies thunder to right hand weapon.

This paper originates from Carcosa, where instead of the gods, there are tales of terrible monstrosities that weave and hunt with the same energy these papers produce. The Carcosan refugees sold these papers to the highest orders they could find; the church and the scholars.</text>
<text id="343">Pine resin that has rotted and turned poisonous.
Likely rotten from the start.

Temporarily applies poison to right-hand weapon.

Farron Keep was swallowed by the rotted wood, where the blunt-horned Ghrus concoct this resin.</text>

Return to last bonfire used for resting,
or to the shrine bonfire.

Bonfires are sustained by bones of the Undead.
In rare cases, their previous owner's strong urge to seek bonfires enchants their bones with a homeward instinct.</text>
<text id="351">Fragment of the coiled sword of a bonfire
which served its purpose long ago.

Returns caster to last bonfire used for resting,
or to the bonfire in Firelink Shrine.
Can be used repeatedly.

Bonfires are linked to one another irreversibly,
retaining their affinity long after their purpose
is exhausted.</text>
<text id="352">Stone imbued with the power of the everlasting dragons, polluted by the Londor warlock Magnus.

Gain the head of an abyssal dragon and emit breath alongside a draconic mirage. The transformation is irreversible until death. In contrast to other transformations, this form favors intelligence more than faith.

Using his knowledge as a devout in the path of the dragon, he preached of power beyond the Gods. Attempting to combine the essence of the human spirit and draconic energy, he doomed his own patients to witness the devastation of the city they held dear.</text>
