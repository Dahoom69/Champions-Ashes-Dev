and vice-versa.

Gwyndolin was raised like a daughter through the
aura of the moon, and was said to behave like
a sullen brooding goddess.</text>

<text id="20830">Ring of Oceiros, former king of Lothric.
Reduces damage from backstabs.

In his later years, Oceiros became fascinated with
dragons. After going mad, he was more commonly
known as the Consumed King. Many assassins were
dispatched to his domain, but none returned.

The Consumed King ascribed his resilience to
the divine protection of the dragon scale.</text>

Allows full movement regardless of environment.

It is terribly rusted, and faintly stained with blood. Those who find this strange ring to their liking will be pleased

<text id="20850">An ancient sapphire ring that subdues your presence, making it difficult to be detected by enemies.

This ring was commonly used by thieves from a distant land to steal without being noticed.

The thief gang thriving in lothric seems to value the ring a lot.</text>
<text id="20860">Massive ring forged by giants in a bygone age.

This ring embodies the unwavering resolve of giants, enabling the wielder to endure blows without flinching.

Such power comes at a heavy price, lowering absorption significantly in player versus player interactions.</text>
<text id="22000">No Lore. Let me just explain how this thing works for PvP.

In Dark Souls some attack strings are inescapable. For most weapon classes for example, the first light attack (R1) into the second light attack is a guaranteed string on hit. 
Meaning you can't roll the second hit after being hit by the first. This is what's usually referred to as a true combo.

So how does this ring work? When you're hit, your character will emit different colors of light.
YELLOW is the initial hitstun.
RED means the last hit could be escaped. 
BLUE means the last hit was a true combo.</text>
