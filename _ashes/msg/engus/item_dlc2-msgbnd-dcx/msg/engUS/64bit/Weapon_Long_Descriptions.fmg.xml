<text id="36030000">A dagger treated with plague. The blade is curved like a talon, and was once used by women and children for assassination.

<text id="41030000">A brutal weapon employed by mercenaries and madmen.

Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack and crude slashes.

The cruel blade invigorates the user as it is soaked in fresh blood, allowing the wielder to fight not unlike a savage beast.

<text id="41120000">This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force.

<text id="41140000">Beautifully crafted blade of foreign make.

Appears as an otherwise standard weapon, but can assume a terrible might when allowed to feast on the wielder's own blood.

Curiously, when imbibed with blood, its strength depends on the wielder's luck. 
Perhaps this is because luck is a uniquely human quality; and it has a particular appetite for the blood of mankind.

Allowing the blood of foes to intermingle with the blood of the wielder replenishes the user's vigor.

Weapon Skill: Scarlet Slash
Send a shockwave of blood through the earth.</text>
<text id="41160000">A trick weapon fashioned by a craftsman of eccentric taste. 

The Stake Driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes.

It allows for high-damage charged attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this bothered its peculiar designer. 

Skill: Mechanical Blast/Powder Keg
Trigger a blast of physical power, sending foes to the ground. When transformed, fire volatile bombs that implode over time.</text>
<text id="41170000">Pistol made by the craftsman Edmond.

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41180000">A large prototype weapon, an attempt at combining an exploding bolt and a ballista. 

Use of this weapon is equivalent to toting a Greatbow on one arm, complete with its ridiculous weight, staggering kick, and lavish use of Focus, into battle. 

Such a monstrosity was doomed from the start, and indeed its development was cut short. 

Yet, against impossibly gigantic foes, it might be just the thing, provided you have the Strength to use it effectively of course. 

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41200000">A sanctified weapon first wielded by Ludwig, figurehead of a group of pious warriors. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword.

Skill: Spinning Motion/Reaping Slashes
Execute a deliberate horizontal attack. When transformed, perform two powerful slashes in rapid succession.</text>
<text id="41220000">Saw Spear</text>

<text id="41240000">A mysterious and marvelous weapon combining a sword and a peculiar firing mechanism, created with craftsmanship far beyond the limits of any known artisan today.

Skill: Countering Thrust/Graceful Salvo
Step backwards and then quickly pierce forward. When transformed, assume a quick stance, lunge forward, and execute a stunning chain attack, letting rip a hail of projectiles.</text>
<text id="41270000">Threaded Cane</text>
<text id="41280000">Special and rare pistol used by a nobleman from Astora. 

The nobleman paid an exorbitant sum for its creation, and no other copies of the Evelyn were ever made. A sum well spent, for the Evelyn is of extreme quality.

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41290000">A pistol typically used by a group of pious warriors.

Crafted with mostly metal parts and exhibiting a complex design, the repeating pistol fires two shots at once, making it a ravenous consumer of Focus. 

Its volatile and experimental design lends the weapon to scale with the wielder’s Luck. 

Should be used sparingly, as the trump card in one's arsenal or else face the risk of being depleted of Focus very quickly. 

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41300000">A rifle typically used by a group of pious warriors.

It is said that this rifle was employed by Ludwig, figurehead of the group. Its long, heavy barrel makes up in range for what it lacks in reload speed.

Ludwig's Rifle exhibits some departures from Edmond’s design, suggesting that Ludwig anticipated a different approach to adversity than his peers.

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41400000">Beasthunter Saif</text>
<text id="41410000">A brutal trick weapon used by thugs and butchers.

This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip.

This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the nights this weapon saw use made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds.

Skill: Sever/Chain Lash
Hold the cleaver with both hands and slash repeatedly at the foe's feet. When transformed, spin the whip around the wielder and transition to a powerful thrust with the blunt of the whip.</text>
<text id="41420000">A uniquely grotesque and brutal instrument.

The Amygdalan Arm earned it's name from the madmen who wielded it, drawing etymological inspiration from the amygdala, an area of the brain associated with primitive emotions, and its unsavoury severance from the carcass of some horrible beast best forgotten.

It can be wielded as a blunt club of sorts, but when extended the beast within stirs, quivering as if yet still living.

Skill: Nightmare Serpent
Thrust the weapon before you, drawing on some terrible lingering power to let forth a shockwave of energy.</text>
<text id="41430000">A mystical sword discovered long ago by Ludwig.

When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.

The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on this form of the great blade. 

It bears a striking resemblance to the Moonlight Greatsword created from the soul of Seathe the Paledrake, but no apparent relation exists. 

Perhaps it simply has a mind of its own, for whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

Skill: Broad Slash/Moonlight Fury
Assume a wide stance and perform a diagonal slash. When transformed, draw the sword back and release to unleash a burst of moonlight. </text>

<text id="41450000">A peculiar hammer powered by a miniature furnace.

<text id="41460000">Cursed mace forged by a heretic.

To the common eye the Bloodletter is nothing more than a rusted morning star, but will assume its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul.

Curiously, the weapon gains its power from the wielder's luck when transformed. Perhaps the human quality of luck is an appealing taste for the savage instrument.

But of course, who could reach a sane conclusion from the creation of a heretic?

Skill: Sanguine Strike
Strike the weapon into the ground in a damaging display of blood, for both the opponent and wielder.</text>
<text id="41470000">Church Pick</text>
<text id="41480000">A vicious weapon forged with outlandish craftsmanship, first wielded by a deranged individual who sought nothing but to witness the rending of flesh. 

This weapon pummels opponents in its mace form, but it's true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. These discs, lined with serrated teeth, spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of those before it into fine shreds.

Skill: Spin Bash/Shredding Stance
Bash foes with a large spinning motion. When transformed, enter a stance that continually slashes foes. Use the normal or strong attack to slash the weapon along the ground on either side.</text>

<text id="41500000">A large, unwieldy device that appears to be the result of trying to fix the issue of the need to reload with conventional crossbows. 

The Gatling Gun boasts exceptional rapid-firing functionality, but is considered a cumbersome weapon, due to its excessive weight and insatiable consumption of Focus and stamina. 

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41510000">A chunk of iron fitted with left handed finger holes. 

A blunt instrument ideal for those that lack the technique to properly handle more conventional weapons. 

Gratia was a simple woman, with simple tastes, such as knocking the lights out of beasts with a lump of solid metal.</text>
<text id="41520000">An oversized weapon, by human standards, created by the Giant Blacksmith of Anor Londo. 

A type of cannon that fires with a curved trajectory and creates an explosion of lightning upon impact, drawing upon the wielder’s Faith. 

Originally designed for use against dragons, but its bombastic design lacked the piercing precision found in the existing Silver Knight weapons. 

As such, it was quietly ushered into permanent storage as a failed experiment in dragon hunting weaponry. 

Skill: Weapon Skill

<text id="41530000">An early prototype rifle engineered by a Carim weaponsmith, creator of the sniper crossbow.

This weapon has been optimized to cause perforation wounds, but it's cumbersome firing rate makes it poor at stopping an aggressive target despite demanding Dexterity of the wielder. 

Perhaps this limitation inspired Edmond to later invent pistols and blunderbusses. 

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>
<text id="41540000">A curious mechanical invention of unclear origin.  

Spits searing flames using Focus as a medium.

Despite its pyrokinetic inclination, this device would be considered heresy by the naturalistic sages of the Great Swamp. 

Its design suggests a more clinical approach, perhaps used by healers to burn away rotted flesh.
