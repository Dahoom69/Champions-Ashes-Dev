Before Lorian embraced his brother's curse, he was a knight who single handedly slayed the demon prince, but the victory eternally scorched his shield.

The shield is imbued with the power of the gods, able to cast miracles.
No dragon hunting kingdom has a ruler who cannot fell a dragon.</text>
<text id="30200000">Talisman used by clerics of the Ringed City.

In a bygone age, these crude talismans were used to wage war against the stone-scaled dragons.
Hollows would pounce upon downed dragons and mercilessly stab at them with these stakes, prying the scales away for attacks from their more capable compatriots.

A morbid irony can be found between the actions of ages past compared to the present, as the Ringed City's most staunch defender can call the hollow's old foe kin.

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this talisman in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>

<text id="30210000">A faithless replica of twin shields used by knights who long ago served as guardians to an undead sanctuary.

<text id="30250000">Large curved sword wielded by the mightiest champion of Carthus.

<text id="35020000">Sword allegedly wielded by servants of the Gravelord.

Numerous ancient skeletons cling to the blade, melded into a macabre exhibition of the Old Dead One's might.

Primordial tales tell of one of the first Great Lords, Nito, the First of the Dead. Waves of lethal miasma would emanate from his blade, granting all it touched death and decay.
The same miasma, however thinned, exudes from this blade.
 
Lord Wolnir sought to control this power, yearning to find the secret of immortality within the cloud of death. His desire was ultimately fulfilled, but the price, ironically, was a fate worse than death.

<text id="36030000">A dagger treated with plague. The blade is curved like a talon, and was once used by women and children for assassination.

The weapon draws its power from Luck, perhaps an ode to the nature of children to believe in such things.

The faint poison lining the blade is uniquely deadly, also reducing the restorative properties of healing items.

Weapon Skill: Bile Spit
Release a corrosive vomit projectile.</text>
<text id="36040000">A rare rapier with spiral grooves carved into the blade.

<text id="41140000">Beautifully crafted blade of foreign make.

Appears as an otherwise standard weapon, but can assume a terrible might when allowed to feast on the wielder's own blood.

Curiously, when imbibed with blood, its strength depends on the wielder's luck. 
Perhaps this is because luck is a uniquely human quality; and it has a particular appetite for the blood of mankind.

Allowing the blood of foes to intermingle with the blood of the wielder replenishes the user's vigor.

Weapon Skill: Scarlet Slash
Send a shockwave of blood through the earth.</text>
<text id="41160000">A trick weapon fashioned by a craftsman of eccentric taste. 

The Stake Driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes.

It allows for high-damage charged attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this bothered its peculiar designer. 

Skill: Mechanical Blast/Powder Keg
Trigger a blast of physical power, sending foes to the ground. When transformed, fire volatile bombs that implode over time.</text>
<text id="41170000">Pistol made by the craftsman Edmond.

A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs.

This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip.

This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the nights this weapon saw use made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds.

Skill: Sever/Chain Lash
Hold the cleaver with both hands and slash repeatedly at the foe's feet. When transformed, spin the whip around the wielder and transition to a powerful thrust with the blunt of the whip.</text>
<text id="41420000">A uniquely grotesque and brutal instrument.

The Amygdalan Arm earned its name from the madmen who wielded it, drawing etymological inspiration from the amygdala, an area of the brain associated with primitive emotions.
The heretical severance from an entity considered sacred led to the creation of this venerated tool of the divine.

It can be wielded as a blunt club of sorts, but when extended the entity within stirs, yearning to spread its influence in the world of men.

The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on this form of the great blade. 

Being used for so long as an instrument with divine intentions, it comes as no surprise it sees itself as such.

Perhaps it simply has a mind of its own, for whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

Skill: Deflecting Slash/Moonlight Fury
Assume a wide stance and perform a diagonal slash. When transformed, draw the sword back and release to unleash a burst of moonlight. </text>

The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on this form of the great blade. 

Light that catches upon the blade's keen edge is reflected as cold and merciless, the blade's will and judgement absolute.

Perhaps it simply has a mind of its own, for whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

Skill: Deflecting Slash/Moonlight Fury
Assume a wide stance and perform a diagonal slash. When transformed, draw the sword back and release to unleash a burst of moonlight. </text>
<text id="41430400">A mystical sword discovered long ago by Ludwig.

When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.

The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on this form of the great blade. 

It bears a striking resemblance to the Moonlight Greatsword created from the soul of Seathe the Paledrake, but no apparent relation exists. 

Perhaps it simply has a mind of its own, for whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.

<text id="41440000">A unique weapon wielded by a mysterious woman. This sword demands great dexterity, a testament to the finesse of its wielder.

One day, the woman abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer.

Skill: Shieldsplitter/Pirouette
Aim carefully, and attack in a large forward lunge to pierce through enemy shields and inflict damage directly. When transformed, perform a graceful spinning attack with the paired blades.</text>
<text id="41450000">A peculiar hammer powered by a miniature furnace.

Striking the mechanism on the head of the hammer empowers the next attack with flame. For what reason would such a mechanism be required?
Surely such a terrifying contraption was made to match the ferocity of the would-be foe.

Skill: Heat Zone
Overcharge the furnace within before unleashing it upon the ground, creating an ecliptic shockwave of destruction while also venting excess material.

<text id="41460000">Cursed mace forged by a heretic.

To the common eye the Bloodletter is nothing more than a rusted morning star, but will assume its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul.

Curiously, the weapon gains its power from the wielder's luck when transformed. Perhaps the human quality of luck is an appealing taste for the savage instrument.

But of course, who could reach a sane conclusion from the creation of a heretic?

Skill: Sanguine Strike
Strike the weapon into the ground in a damaging display of blood, for both the opponent and wielder.</text>
<text id="41470000">Church Pick</text>
<text id="41480000">A vicious weapon forged with outlandish craftsmanship, first wielded by a deranged individual who sought nothing but to witness the rending of flesh. 

This weapon pummels opponents in its mace form, but it's true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. These discs, lined with serrated teeth, spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of those before it into fine shreds.

Skill: Spin Bash/Shredding Stance
Bash foes with a large spinning motion. When transformed, enter a stance that continually slashes foes. Use the normal or strong attack to slash the weapon along the ground on either side.</text>
<text id="41490000">Choice weapon of Simon, close friend of Edmond the Craftsman.

Simon despised Edmond's firearms, and so he had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a longbow when transformed.

The illusory arrows channel the user's Focus to fire; the arrows can be shot without Focus, although the effectiveness of the arrows without it is minimal.

Skill: Blood Bullet Technique
Impale the left leg with a blood draining needle, replenishing Focus at the cost of ones Vigor.</text>

<text id="41500000">A large, unwieldy device that appears to be the result of trying to fix the issue of the need to reload with conventional crossbows. 

The Gatling Gun boasts exceptional rapid-firing functionality, but is considered a cumbersome weapon, due to its excessive weight and insatiable consumption of Focus and stamina. 

Skill: Weapon Skill
Equipping this in the left hand allows one to perform the Skill of the right hand weapon.</text>

<text id="41510000">A chunk of iron fitted with left handed finger holes. 

A blunt instrument ideal for those that lack the technique to properly handle more conventional weapons. 

Gratia was a simple woman, with simple tastes, such as knocking the lights out of beasts with a lump of solid metal.</text>
<text id="41520000">An oversized weapon, by human standards, created by the Giant Blacksmith of Anor Londo. 

A type of cannon that fires with a curved trajectory and creates an explosion of lightning upon impact, drawing upon the wielder’s Faith. 

Originally designed for use against dragons, but its bombastic design lacked the piercing precision found in the existing Silver Knight weapons. 

As such, it was quietly ushered into permanent storage as a failed experiment in dragon hunting weaponry.

<text id="41530000">An early prototype rifle engineered by a Carim weaponsmith, creator of the sniper crossbow.

This weapon has been optimized to cause perforation wounds, but it's cumbersome firing rate makes it poor at stopping an aggressive target despite demanding Dexterity of the wielder. 

Perhaps this limitation inspired Edmond to later invent pistols and blunderbusses.

<text id="41540000">A curious mechanical invention of unclear origin.  

Spits searing flames using Focus as a medium.

Despite its pyrokinetic inclination, this device would be considered heresy by the naturalistic sages of the Great Swamp. 

Its design suggests a more clinical approach, perhaps used by healers to burn away rotted flesh.

<text id="41550000">Beastly weapon wielded by the Madman Chieftan.
Those who tame the lycan are revered by the dungeon-dwelling clan, proclaiming them as their leader.

Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead lycan and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power.

As flesh and blood is spread across the battlefield, the wielder of this weapon surges with strength at the cost of resilience.

Skill: Bestial Embrace
Let out a bestial roar, allowing the regeneration of health as claws tear through flesh.</text>
<text id="41560000">An atypical weapon only described by sickly, inhuman sounds.

Once from a body of an unfortunate undead burst open, the consuming corruption manifesting itself as Abyss incarnate.

The parasite aged and growing a sickly blue suggests control from a host, although taking characteristics from its former beastly form.

Skill: Celestial Yearning
Wrap yourself in abyssal tendrils, launching an explosive crescendo of arcane power.</text>
