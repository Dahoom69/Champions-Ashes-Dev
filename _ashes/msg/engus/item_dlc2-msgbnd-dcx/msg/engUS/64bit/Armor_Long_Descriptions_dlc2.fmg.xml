<text id="28501000">Ordinary garb from an ancient land of sorcery.
The gold embellishments betray a faint residue
of magic, but this clothing was never intended
for battle.

When a mission visited the Ringed City long ago,
one of its younger missionaries elected to stay
behind. It was he who became the last recorded
Spear of the Church.</text>
<text id="28502000">These arm wrappings, sewn with violet cloth and
embroidered with gold thread, were intended for
everyday use.

Yet they served well enough in many a battle,
enwreathing the arms of one who would go on to embrace the sword.</text>
<text id="28503000">Undergarments combined with an overlayer,
the former never intended for public display.

Indeed, all manner of things are bound
to accrue at world's end.

<text id="29500000">Crown of Shira, knight in service to Filianore.
Finely crafted with silver and fashioned with
a pearl from a Man Eater Shell.

Shira delivered the crucified mad king to a
darkroom, where she stayed, in her formal wear,
even though none would see her.
</text>
<text id="29501000">Armor of Shira, knight in service to Filianore.
A rare women's piece from ancient times.

With a spun gold shawl draped over the silver
breastplate and a green woven skirt,
this armor offers a subdued yet refined elegance,
apropos to both a handmaiden of the Princess
and one whose veins coarse with royal blood.

</text>
<text id="29502000">Gloves of Shira, knight in service to Filianore.
Crafted with carthamin leather
and graced with brass buttons.

One article of Shira's knight garb.</text>
<text id="29503000">Trousers of Shira,
knight in service to Filianore.
Made of carthamin leather boots
over a silk underlayer.

<text id="32000000">Steel helm of the amnesiac Lapp.

This plate-armor helm, that covers
the head cleanly without even slight gaps,
provides heavy defense.

Quite fit to conceal a hollowed body, and indeed,
one's very identity.</text>

one's very identity.</text>
<text id="63500000">The hood of the Ringed Knights.

These knights don Abyss-tainted black cloth,
with layer upon layer hiding their eyes.

This was nothing less than an attempt to reveal
that which the seal of fire has occluded,
a subtle defiance of the gods' wishes. </text>
<text id="63501000">Malformed black armor of the Ringed Knights.
The armor of early men was forged in the Abyss,
and betrays a smidgen of life.

For this reason the gods cast a seal of fire upon
such armor, and those who possessed them.

<text id="64490000">Abyssal visage of the Harald Legion, who sought the dark soul.

The legion sank into the dark, their original helmets corrupted into this seething mass of humanity.</text>
<text id="64500000">Overflowing abyssal visage of the Harald Legion, who sought the dark soul.

The legion sank into the dark, their original helmets corrupted into this seething mass of humanity. </text>
<text id="64501000">Armor worn by the Harald Legion, who sought
the dark soul.

The armor sank into the dark with the legion,
where their cavities bloated in grotesque displays,　never again to fit any ordinarily-shaped body.</text>
<text id="64502000">Gauntlets worn by the Harald Legion, who sought
the dark soul.

The gauntlets sank into the dark with the legion,
the leather partly melted and the metal pieces
showing signs of an unsightly bloating.</text>
<text id="64503000">Leggings worn by the Harald Legion, who sought
the dark soul.

The leggings sank into the dark with the legion,
the leather partly melted and the metal pieces
showing signs of an unsightly bloating.</text>
<text id="67500000">Stark melted iron helm of the ancient
Dragonslayer Armour.

The Armour, defeated by the Champion of Ash
in Lothric, was left ages to rust, until it
slipped into an abyssal swamp, where it was
possessed once again by the memory of the hunt.</text>

<text id="68500000">An empty head of a white-faced locust
that rose from an abyssal swamp.

The white-faced locusts were meant to beckon men to the dark with sermons, but most of them are unable to think past their own stomachs. Someone must rise to the occasion, and restore the path of righteousness.

Perhaps that someone is you? Did you not arise from the Abyss, and did you not resist drowning in the Age of Fire? Locusts and men are kindred spirits.
Why not don this head, and join them in likeness?</text>
<text id="80500000">Helm of the company of knights who were sent
to the Ringed City on an old king's orders.

The knights sought the dark soul, but were
so soundly crushed, they had little choice but
to swear themselves to the Judicator Giant.

The ill-fated company was later immortalized in
a dark fable, inspiring the aspect of certain
golems in whom their name lived on.</text>

<text id="81500000">Hood of the desert pyromancers,
who once walked the halls of the Earthen Peak.
It is said that the thin burgundy cloth
breathes with magic.

Desert pyromancers, most of them female,
were known for their great fans of flame,
and enchanting looks.

But what is enchanting can also be deadly,
especially when clothed in such alluring garb.</text>

<text id="82500000">The purple hat of the witch Zullie,
who intended to seduce Alva the Wayfarer,
but eventually became his closest supporter, spending her entire life with him.

The pointed hat is a symbol of heretical magical crafts, and Zullie wore hers with an unspoken, but deep sense of pride.</text>
<text id="82501000">The purple garb of the witch Zullie,
who intended to seduce Alva the Wayfarer,
but eventually became his closest supporter,
spending her entire life with him.

It is said that Zullie the witch,
who was never loved, nor loved another, experienced all manner of misfortune,
and yet in the end, found her purpose in life.</text>

<text id="83500000">The purple veil of the witch Zullie,
who intended to seduce Alva the Wayfarer,
but eventually became his closest supporter,
spending her entire life with him.

Zullie's veil was for travel, and to hide her
affiliation with the misunderstood craft of witches.</text>
<text id="84500000">An eye-occluding mask of unknown origin.
Small cracks allow the wearer to see.

Strengthens dark attacks, but also greatly
increases damage sustained from dark.

This purple steel creation has a certain
resemblance to the Fire Keeper's crown,
but the similarity is purely cosmetic.</text>
