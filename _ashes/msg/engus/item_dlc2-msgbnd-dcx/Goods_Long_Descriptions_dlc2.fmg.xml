<text id="315">This special throwing blade has a flat tip, and is wielded by guardians of the Church of Filianore.

Consume FP to project illusory blades which
seek their targets.

Guardians of the Church, of whom few remain,
watch over Princess Filianore's eternal slumber
along with the Spears of the Church.</text>
<text id="379">The Spears of the Church watch over the Princess' slumber, and this serves as proof of their fulfillment of their duty. 
The embellished gold cloth is woven with a crest of young grass.

The Princess' knights proudly displayed these
precious favors, which were most often seen
swaying from their identical ceremonial spears.</text>

<text id="605">Crush to become cursed and increase soul absorption.
The souls of fallen heroes found along the way salute those who scoff at danger and bravely seek the harder path.

Crushing the coin Increases soul absorption from defeated enemies, but curses your passive poise.
Attracts more attention from foes.

-50 passive poise for x1.1 soul gain</text>

<text id="620">Proof of a pact, employed by the Judicator Giant.
Briefly summons the eccentric Silver Knight Ledo.

Most bound by the Judicator's pact are not
willing but rather impelled. Yet a rare few are
linked to the giant by mutual friendship.

This is a precious corroboration of such
amiability, and the only one that manifested
in physical form.</text>

<text id="650">Online play item.
A fragment of the matching ritual spears once
held by the knights of Princess Filianore.

They are the namesake of the Spears of the Church.

When Spears of the Church face unduly
treacherous foes, this allows them to
draw upon former majesty, and summon
a row of upward-thrusting ritual spears.

<text id="651">Online play item.
A fragment of the matching ritual spears once
held by the knights of Princess Filianore.

These Divine Spears of gold were placed in
the trusted hands of exalted Spears.

When Spears of the Church face unduly
treacherous foes, this allows them to
draw upon former majesty, and summon
a row of upward-thrusting ritual spears.

<text id="745">Soul of Slave Knight Gael.
One of the twisted souls, steeped in strength.

Use to acquire many souls, or transpose
to extract its true strength.

The red-hooded, wandering slave knight Gael
sought the blood of the dark soul
as pigment for the Painted World.
But Gael knew he was no Champion,
that the dark soul would likely ruin him,
and that he had little hope of a safe return.</text>
<text id="746">Soul of the demon prince.
One of the twisted souls, steeped in strength.

Use to acquire many souls, or transpose
to extract its true strength.

The demons, birthed from a common Chaos, share almost everything between them, even the pride of their prince, and his near-faded flame.

So that the last demon standing may rekindle it.</text>
<text id="747">Soul of Darkeater Midir.
One of the twisted souls, steeped in strength.

Use to acquire many souls, or transpose
to extract its true strength.

Midir, descendant of Archdragons, was raised
by the gods, and owing to his immortality,
was given a duty to eternally battle the dark,
a duty that he would never forget, even after
the gods perished.</text>
<text id="2156">The small banner used by envoys of
Great Lord Gwyn in the days of yore.

Face the ringed cliff and hold the banner high
to summon facilitators of transport.

For the pygmies, who took the dark soul,
the Great Lord gifted the Ringed City,
an isolated place at world's end, and his
beloved youngest daughter, promising her
that he would come for her when the day came.</text>
<text id="2157">Umbral ash of the old stone-humped woman. With
this, the shrine handmaid will prepare new items.

Things that have dreadfully run their course
accrue at the great dreg-heap. This old woman
was once the wet nurse of royalty.</text>
<text id="2158">Blood of the dark soul that seeped from the
hole within Slave Knight Gael.

Used as pigment by his lady in Ariandel
to depict a painted world.

When Gael came upon the pygmy lords,
he discovered that their blood had long ago
dried, and so consumed the dark soul.</text>
<text id="2159">A small, transparent stone that once graced the green young grass crest.

This semi-precious gem honors a Spear of Church after a battle well-fought, and is said to slightly enhance their blessing of protection.
(while held, this effect is constant)</text>

<text id="1376000">A memory of an old sword found deep within Midir.
This sorcery uses souls to grant form to the
thought, and attack with it.

Attacks are coupled with lightwaves,
and sustaining the stance before attacking
increases their speed and potency.

The sword is named after moonlight, but it is
slightly different than the one fashioned of the
paledrake Seath. Perhaps it is rooted in an
older memory, from not long after the Beginning.</text>
<text id="1604000">A sorcery that fires great dark soul dregs
that have stewed for ages, far within the deep.

This sorcery is the highest form of Deep Soul.

Some of the murkmen who rise from the depths
are possessed by soul dregs, which have a
grave likeness to the human form.</text>
<text id="1605000">Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile sorcerer on the brink of madness. 

Fire successive Dark Orbs.

In contrast to standard soul sorceries, Abyss sorceries are weighty and inflict dark damage. Perhaps a human soul is closer to matter in its humanity.</text>
<text id="1606000">Sorcery of Archdeacon Royce and his deacons, conjuring dark orbs that form a grand deep soul.

The deep soul grows in size as it channels power, seeking foes and exploding on impact.

This sorcery, the ultimate form of Deep Soul, reflects the deepest communion with darkness, surpassing all previous iterations.</text>
<text id="2458000">Pyromancy of Zoey, descendant of the desert
pyromancers.

Use repeatedly to brush the fan of flame left
and right.

Zoey possessed true beauty, as did all the
desert pyromancers, but hers did not poison,
and so she became the unassuming queen
of the feeble ones. </text>
<text id="2660000">The last flame lit by the demon prince.
This pyromancy hurls a clump of chaos.

Upon impact, this clump of chaos seethes wildly,
condenses briefly, then explodes violently.

To the demons, these clumps are shreds of life.</text>
<text id="3509000">The few female knights who served in the age of
the gods used this miracle for dragonslaying.

Draw lightning bow to fire a lightning arrow.

The lightning arrows offer a great improvement
to the range of spears, and were said to have been used to pierce the eyes of dragons from afar.
But remember, beautiful stories are always
marked by embellishment.
</text>
<text id="3557000">A miracle discovered in the last days of Lothric.
Toss a light that heals those near the point of impact.

Even those who had forgotten the caress and bounty of the Princess of Sunlight did their best to recall her image. The stories spun about her were most certainly childish, and yet gravely sincere.</text>
