******************
* ASHES LAUNCHER *
******************

Installing, updating, enabling, and disabling is all handled by the launcher now.
Place tha launcher in your root game directory and launche it.

TIP:
\AshesLauncher\Disabled
Any files in this folder will be copied to your game directory when you disable the mod.
For example if you put WexDust's dinput8.dll there it will enable it when you disale the mod.

Files starting with _ will be ignored and won't be copied over to the main game directory.

LEGACY_INSTALLATION
------------
Unzip the downloaded file, then place:
		
	_ashes (the whole folder) 
	dinput8.dll
	modengine.ini

in your root game directory. (where the darksoulsIII.exe is)


LEGACY_UNINSTALLATION
--------------
Rename the "dinput8.dll" file to something else, like "disable_dinput8.dll".
This will completely disable the mod and return your game to its vanilla state.


IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
This mod WILL ban you if you have it enabled and launch the game. 
Make sure it's disabled before using a character that you don't want banned.
