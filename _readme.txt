* ASHES LAUNCHER *
******************

The Ashes Launcher fully handles installation, updates, enabling, and disabling of the mod.  
Simply run the launcher and direct it to your Dark Souls III root game directory.

INSTALLATION (Recommended)
--------------------------
1. Download and extract the Ashes Launcher.
2. Run the launcher and set your Dark Souls III root game directory (where DarkSoulsIII.exe is located).
3. The launcher will automatically install the mod and downpatch your game to version 1.15.0 for compatibility.
4. Click "Enable Mod" and then "Play" to launch Champion’s Ashes.

HOW TO USE THE LAUNCHER
-----------------------
The Ashes Launcher includes several buttons for managing the mod:

- Enable Mod / Disable Mod:  
  This button toggles between modded and vanilla mode.  
  - When it says "Mod Enabled", the mod is active.  
  - When it says "Vanilla Mode", the mod is disabled, allowing you to play the base game safely.  

- Play:  
  Starts Dark Souls III with the current settings.  
  If an update is available, the launcher will automatically download and install the latest version before launching the game.  

- Use Private Servers (Checkbox):  
  Check this box to enable online play through private servers.  
  - Make sure "Mod Enabled" is active.  
  - Press "Play" to launch the game with the private servers.  
  WARNING: **Do not attempt to play on official Dark Souls III servers with the mod enabled.** This will result in a ban.  

- Reset All Files (MODS Tab):  
  If you experience issues, click this button.  
  - This restores all mod files and may take a few minutes.  
  - The launcher may appear unresponsive—do not close it until it finishes.  

- Update Check:  
  The launcher automatically checks for updates. If an update is available, it will prompt you to install it before launching the game.
