******************
* ASHES LAUNCHER *
******************

Installing, updating, enabling, and disabling is all handled by the launcher now.
Run the launcher and direct it to your root game directory.


LEGACY_INSTALLATION
------------
Unzip the downloaded file, and place:
	
	dinput8.dll
	modengine.ini

in your root game directory. (where the darksoulsIII.exe is)
and then place:

	_ashes (the entire folder)
	GraphicPresets (the entire folder)
	AshesPatcher.dll
	AshesPatcher.ini
	
in Game\AshesLauncher\Ashes (create these folders if they do not exist)	 


LEGACY_UNINSTALLATION
--------------
Rename the "dinput8.dll" file to something else, like "disable_dinput8.dll", and remove the AshesPatcher.dll from the game folder.
This will completely disable the mod and return your game to its vanilla state.


IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
This mod WILL ban you if you have it enabled and launch the game. 
Make sure it's disabled before using a character that you don't want banned.
